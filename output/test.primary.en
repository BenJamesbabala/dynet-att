when steve gandhi , scott of los angeles times , one day , through the streets at the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man with a man , a shower , a minister , a bunch of guns , a homeless , a robot that was only two .
many of you will know the story because it was later a book that was a book that was being done with , with robert , with robert 's new york at steve , and when you 're going to run
and left left , went to a date , and 30 years later , he was living in the streets of their streets in the center of los angeles .
i 'm telling you to read all of you , reading the book , or to look at the movie , which is not just the really wonderful things that are between those two men , but also how the music made these connection and how they finally was the instrument of how they finally
and i met dr. bike in 2008 , two years ago , in the most successful lab of california .
he had just taken an article from a series of l.a. 's first , and i heard the stage , and came up behind the stage to imagine me .
he was talking to a very elaborate , and he went to talk about santa papers and tim clinton , and how the scientists would never put in the front world as well . and this is all because of the luxury of the launch video of
we were talking to talk about the topic of music , and a few days later , i received an email in that , which was that there was a lot of a sudden for me to come to me .
i 've got to mention a medical treatment , because it 's already been filled with lions and a lot of it , and it 's a company that has been keeping him all over life .
now , as a result of it , he 's now very vulnerable to this kind of thing , and these are sometimes so bad , and he was walking around the streets of amsterdam in the streets of amsterdam , including to that piece of baseball and the
and in that very cold , when we started working with our first tour at the ministry of california , he had this shot in his eyes and lost lost .
he was talking about national health and smoke , and he wanted to look for someone in the street .
i was scared , i was n't , but i was afraid that i could lose it in one of his war , and that i could give him his relationship to a space , when i started talking about , to talk about ,
so i just started to play .
i was playing the first sentence of bilbao .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in my own eyes had a very different transformation .
it was as if it was under the effect of an invisible , a chemical reaction , a chemical reaction .
and dance 's friends turned into understanding , in a sense of curiosity , rather curiosity .
and just like a miracle , he took his head and started to play a little bit of armor and asked me to turn it to the end of her : open , open , toilet .
and we started talking to talk about music , starting to be written about , like , dancing , and all the other , all up to our own .
and i realized that he did n't just read a full knowledge about music , but it was also a unique personal relationship with her .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i just could n't tell from my colleagues in the front of los angeles .
by talking about music and talking about music , this was from this man , man man , who was just walking through the streets of los angeles , a bit of , forced , forced , to become a professional democratic musicians .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
so it 's true , it says , it means it 's called
because the music allows him to express his thoughts and acceptance of their imagination and creativity in something real .
and that 's what he 's doing his legacy .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
this is the reason why we 're doing music : so that we 're something that in all of us , deep within the inside , our emotions , through our collective , through our creativity can be able to make reality .
and the reality of it gets all of us , and it 's moving , and it moves , and it 's moving us .
what happens , so it took him the music back into a community of friends .
the power force of music took him back to a family of musicians who understood him who had his talent .
and i 'm going to go back and play with play music , whether you 're going to go to college disney , or in august , because he reminds me why i 've been trained .
thank you very much .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert chen .
robert cohen : i want to play a bit that i have forgotten the books on .
i hope you feel ashamed .
so i 've met a lot of dinosaurs in my life .
i just have two words .
this first , this was more like an intellectual experience .
it was a nice fish , fresh , a good body , a little bit on top of it .
what a fish .
even better , it 's been used to become the best highest extension of sustainability .
so you could feel like to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty .
one day called the head of the company , and i asked if i could participate in an event about the sustainability 's sustainability .
`` of course , '' i said .
here was a company that was trying to do this , which is this incredible problem for us , how do we do fish on our heads ?
in the last 50 years , we 've created the oceans of the ocean 's way we 've made of forests .
it 's hard to avoid the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , who we love , the ones , the ones , the stratosphere , they have collapsed .
there 's almost no longer left .
so , you 're going to do or buy , i 'm going to be part of our future .
a lot of the things on this . is called the environment , most of them , and they 're inefficient , and we form them . a big deal .
he 's got an invitation from 15 to one .
that means you have to get 15 pounds of pounds , you 've got to get a loan .
not very sustainable .
it does n't seem very good .
so here , finally , a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to warn her .
the day before i was called the head of public health for the company .
let 's call him him .
scrappers said , i said , `` just to get the facts out , you 're famous for the sea , as far out of the sea , you know , you do n't need the environment . ''
`` that 's true , '' he said , `` we are so far out of our fish that is not available . ''
and then we put it in , `` we are basically a personal world .
this is taking off of an opera , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
one , great .
`` what are you going to do ? what do you do ? ''
`` clever proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said . i said .
and on that evening , i was in the bed and i thought , what was the hell of this ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , i started .
and i said , `` well , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? ''
he said he did n't do this . he 'll go .
well , i come with a couple of people in the company . nobody could give me a set of answer to me , and until i finally go with the wild , i liked french .
let 's also call it the way we 've got it .
scrappers , i said , `` well , what for example , are sustainable proteins ? ''
well , he 's talking about some algae and some friends , and then he said , `` well .
i said , `` huh ? ''
and he said , `` yes , skin , liver , liver , and food . ''
i said , `` well , how much percent of your body mean is chicken ? ''
in terms of maybe two percent .
`` well , this is about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` well , what 's a natural way of being chicken ? ''
there was a long time going up and he said , `` well , there 's too much chicken in the world . ''
i was making this fish .
no , not , because i 'm a doctor and i 'm hungry .
that 's what i am .
no , actually , i was actually making this fish of this fish , because , i swear with god , who 's a fish that 's a fish that 's a fish that 's a fish that 's a fish that 's going to
this second fish , this is a different kind of thing .
it 's the kind of romantic way , the kind better you know , the better you know about your fish , you 'll see the fish more love .
i put him in a restaurant in l.a .
now , i 've been a very popular journalist for a long time .
it has kind of a way to think about it .
he came to the table with a light , almost white white color .
and the guy had offered him .
wait .
one thing was still a little bit .
who can make a fish feel so good for him ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
call him call him . in fact , he 's called chinese .
and no , he does n't eat the fish , and he 's not a professor . at least in the way that you and i see it .
he 's a dance video game at la la .
this is a turning up in the open corner of a factory .
she 's near the head of the river .
until the 1980s was in the hands of tehran .
what they 're doing is based on what they were essentially .
they did it by opening up the country .
they built these techniques , and they built the water out of the land , and then it goes into the river .
well , they could n't do it , not sustainable .
and what it was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds .
and so , bangladesh , a japanese company put bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water .
they literally have the same kind of thing .
instead of the water , they used the frogs to make the water back again .
they 're wearing the maggots .
they created a wall of chocolate bike -- free , boom , boom , that -- and then they have masters , and his company -- his company is the central state entirely way .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen anything .
they 're looking at the edge that is a million miles away , and all they 're going to see are are protected eggs , and that density , which is the same age .
i was n't there at the time there was n't a long time ago .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin , and a piece of `` a fan . ''
okay ? we were there , and we sat around the world , and i went and herbie , and i moved to my knees , and he calls it into a company .
here it takes us for every single virus .
now , he 's looking at the power of green .
and here , this is a pattern of what it 's a little bit .
it turns out that the last part of his career has lived in a national park in africa .
and i asked him how he got to become a cyborg .
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know about fish .
i 'm an expert of relationships . ''
and then it goes up and it goes into more and more of all the most vulnerable birds and algae and weird .
and do n't get me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the community community community in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was broken , and this was a little piece of wild fish that i had .
so i bought it . i said , `` greg , how does it feel like your fish sound ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy , the liver , the relationships , the relationships , this is incredible .
but what do you eat ?
what is the cat ? ''
well , he 's going to tell me that it 's such a permanent system , that the fish eat what they eat in the wild .
so the brewers , the dolphins , the dotcom , is what the fish are .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely costly .
there is no food .
you know , ever from a dead , who are n't going to use the animals ?
later on the day , i was walking around this room with tea , and i asked him , i said , `` for a place that 's so natural , '' than every farm that i 've ever been about , `` how do you
in the moment it was as if you wanted to make a veil .
and we walked around the corner , and we 'd like to see the most amazing picture , thousands of thousands of thousands and thousands of wood , which is literally a black line that 's going to be pretty much .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look at your toes , '' sand .
they 're dancing . ''
well ? i was totally confused .
i said , `` greg , do n't you eat your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we do n't lose 20 percent of our fish , and keep them to the birds .
well , last year , on this mountain range of birds , more than seven species .
it 's the greatest largest one , and one of the most important successful workers in europe .
i said , `` greg , is a good thing you have n't the last thing that you want to have on a date ? ''
he throws his head , no .
he said , `` we 're building . ''
this is an organic network .
that 's called the hall .
the name of food gave us .
so , the thing you have to do is better the system . ''
okay , let 's imagine that . a farm that does n't use your own animals , and a farm that 's its success at your own health .
but a cat , but also a shock .
oh , and you should n't be able to see those organs of organs .
they walked in a town of a town , where the sun 's better is for disaster .
every morning you 're going to fly back miles to the farm .
and every night they 'll fly back miles back .
they 're doing it because they can see white waves of the air .
seriously .
and i had started a sort of journey for the penguins , so i kind of love .
i said , `` greg , do you come up to your farm and then you 'll go back miles back in the evening ?
do you do that for the kids ? ''
and he looked at me , like i just played a song at the same house .
he said , `` no . they do that because food is better . ''
i did n't look for the skin of my book , the sound , and i do n't like it . i do n't like it . i do n't like it .
it 's this leather , it 's a mess .
i do n't know almost that .
and yet , when i saw her in this restaurant in tanzania , she did n't have to look for him .
she 's crazy cute , and in a sense , as if you take a sample of the ocean .
i mentioned about the company and i put it .
he said , `` the skin will like a fire .
it 's the last length before something moving into the body .
it has evolved over over the evolution of evolution .
and then he goes off , `` but our water does n't have a bust . ''
okay . a farm that does n't eat your teeth , a farm that does n't really success your success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that does n't have a monopoly , he made a lot of water , because the water that 's coming through this farm is coming from the river .
it 's a river that 's all of the things that are available to today , and it 's associated with them , chemical neurons , by pipes .
and when it came through the system , and that piece of water is the water of water that 's water than it is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not only do a farm that either do n't use their animals , not just a farm they can do at success in the health of their own , but a farm that is literally for those fish , and not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
because when the water goes , it puts it in the forest .
a drop on the ocean , i know , but i suppose it , and i should also do it , because that kind of thing , as it always turns , it 's also a matter .
you might say that she 's a recipe for the future of good food , whether we 're talking about aids or national .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , of one in which it 's actually good .
but for a lot of people , that 's a little bit .
we do n't have surgery ; we 're hungry . we 're ready .
we love skype . we love little boots . we talk about food food , we eat food .
and if you think that these things are the things that the future of the future means someone else goes up and say , `` hey , hey , i love holy pants , but how are they going to the world ?
how do you feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like that question .
no , not because we 've already enough enough to save the world more than simply .
one billion people will get today today .
one billion -- that 's more than ever -- is because of a sudden you look in the distribution , it 's not natural gas .
well , i do n't like that question because it 's the logic of our own house over 50 years .
it 's used to market , when we eat more than cheaper , so , chemicals on earth , and all of the time , they simply have said , `` if we eat more people , how fast can it be ? ''
this was the instructor . it was the art company ; it was the u.s. government of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is to have a financial factory in a local system that 's rapidly sensitive to a local system that is able to allow its production .
this is not a problem , and it 's not agriculture .
now , if we 're born in today , not because of open , but because they need resources .
do n't go through all of the ladies , and you 're going through , you know , but by investing in the country , not by plastic , but by liquid water , not by flickr , but by forests , and not through a way of fish and
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how will we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we make the conditions that each community has to feed themselves to themselves ?
to do that , do n't look for the future for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are at it , and it has never really good for food .
so , let 's see what we 're doing on a global model .
this is that , it took me to two billion years .
look , like , farmers like broccoli .
companies that do n't go online to be able to do the use rather rather than to attract food , to do not just affordable , farmers that are not only caring , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are experts for themselves .
and if i 'm really honest , i 'll be a better person than i 'll ever be .
you know , i 'm right , because if that 's the future of good food , it will be cheap .
thank you .
if i want to present to you today today , it 's that the amount of data that we consume , is bigger than the sum of your parts , and instead of doing it , you know , you can think about how we can think about how we can use information so we can use information
so what we 're seeing here is a typical year old age .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
it 's called , and what i can do with is that i can look at a certain point , let 's say .
and immediately , i see another pattern .
and that is because , because it 's the people who are most vulnerable , and they 're over here .
we can take one step further , and then we 'll see the data , and look at the same time , but not for everyone .
if we 're going to go further , and after age , we say , say , 40 years or we 'll see we we 'll have a little thousand years , we 'll see that actually , in fact , the knowledge is the most important thing to be concerned about
and what you see is that this is especially in men .
so , you realize that this is information from information and data in that way , it 's a lot of swimming in a dense culture .
and if we can do that for data , why not for content ?
so what we 've now here is we 've got a look at what we 've created in here , which is what you 've ever seen .
it 's all here . it 's all online .
you can do it with my talk in your computer test .
they can turn it in a decade .
you can turn it into a certain year .
you can get directly to a certain angle .
now , when i look here , i look at the gods that are going to come in this bag and blow it up .
i 'm a blank blank fan , so i 'm going to go around and i 'm going to watch all of you who will show me all of the people in which i 'm mentioned .
now , if i just want to get a little bit , i could think , `` ok , what if i remember everything about what i 'm going to see ? ''
so , i 'm going to take a step back and i 'm going to look at the way
now , i look at stones .
and so you get an idea of that if you put in this kind of information , you 're going , you 're going , you know , you 're going , you 're going to do n't mean or do n't just do it .
you make something that 's actually a little bit different .
it 's something between , and we think it changes the way that information can be used as information .
so i want to take that idea a little bit further than something crazy .
what we 've done here is we 've taken each single sheet and it 's on a little bit .
it 's a little bit of a time and a symbol for the scale it comes from .
i 'm just going to show you the top of the top 500 of those who are in the
but even in this context , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get an insight about the issues that are based on wikipedia .
now , i 'm going to do that issue for me .
now , after i 've chosen , i do n't know that the germans , most of all of this sudden , `` people of the year . ''
this is really important , because this is an insight that is not in a single sample .
that 's just when you look at a step and look at it .
in addition to a certain of this proposition , i can then go into this topic as a moment , `` people of the year , '' and everyone together .
now , if i look at all of these people , i know the majority of them are , some come out of science , some of them come from the economy . here 's my boss . and one comes from
and interestingly , a ted is a ted prize .
so we can go and look at this and look at every ted 's name .
you can see that we 're in the web as if it 's really a network , not just from side to side , but much more elegant .
and so , i want to show you what other people might be a little surprise .
i just show you just the new york times website .
now , use , this method -- i do n't want to call it a browser ; it 's really not a rocket set , but you can look around online -- and we 're bringing this to every single website like this .
so , i can go back one step , and i can go directly directly to a particular jump .
so this is important important , because you 're just looking through it in this way , all the way that you can look at the same way .
so i can zoom in my life in a certain way .
here 's the only picture i had to come to the way up .
and i can tell you what i 've got here today , again .
and so , if i come and take a step and look at everything , i can actually see my life again after my shop , and here , i 've been looking for me for me to sleep , or i 'm going to end up here .
and from here , i can go back to the side and make it back .
it 's a metaphor that is always used again , and every time it makes the big difference as the sum of all .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a valid .
we 're talking about the legacy of the ipad .
we 're talking about `` cancer in information . ''
what if we could take that situation and turn the internet on its head , so that we can instead instead of looking from one to the other , from a lot of things that if we could turn that situation and make a pattern which had otherwise been hidden
if we can do that , then this will be a new source of information information .
and instead of just being able to move in information , we can get to know .
and if we know about it , then we may even get it out of it .
that 's what i say thank you very much .
i grew up with some of the most passionate of science fiction science .
in my school , i went to school every day per hour .
and my nose used always in a book , a piece that i thought my thoughts in different worlds , and in a sense of mine , my head always has moved me through me , deeply curiosity .
and it also struck me that i was always when i did n't go to school , through the forests , the forests , the forests , and they roll , and they were dancing and rocks and wind and turned it all home and looked under the microscope
i was totally cold , you know .
it 's always been trying to understand the world , to understand the boundaries of the potential .
and my other love of science was that in my environment , because then in the late '60s , we went to the moon , and we looked at the deep sea .
and in '96 , came out into our living room with his remarkable shows that both of us animals and places and a whole world we 've never imagined before .
that 's probably a very good thing to do that .
and i was artists .
i was able to paint . i could paint .
and there was n't some video about these records of video video ] going to have been the whole paintings in the media world , i had to take the pictures in my head .
so we had to do that . if we were reading the book , we took the description of it , and we put it on the screen in our heads .
so my response was to paint and paint from this whole lot of natural worlds , three-dimensional worlds , robots , and all of that .
in lebanon , i was always used to the teachers , like i was standing inside of my face ,
the creativity had to come out of it .
and there was something interesting , which was what i 've been talking about -- at tedglobal , the idea of a totally totally unknown world on our earth .
certainly , i would never never find a way to go off with a bar . and that seemed to be pretty surprising .
but here , i was a world that i could actually put out here on earth , and it was so fascinating and profound like all that , i had always imagined when i read these books .
so , i decided , when i was 15 , i decided .
the only problem was that i was living in a small town in canada , 1,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
but i did n't have the same time .
i remember my father , at the end of it , until finally i was building a factory in new york , new york , had done just on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my job in a local store in the winter in winter in tanzania , new york .
but the ocean , you know , i got only two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , you know , you 've got about three times a thousand hours of water . 500 hours of it in you .
and what i 've learned is that the world of the brain itself , even in the arctic ocean , is so rich in liquid life than we really have to imagine .
the nature of nature knows no borders , in terms of our own mental human imagination .
up to the age of days , i think i think of the nervous of what i see in my 20s .
and my love to the ocean does , with the same intensity as well as well .
so when i was looking at as an adult , it was the dancing .
and that seemed the best way of my mind , to tell stories , with my desire , images .
as a child , i was always going around .
so , movies , the way , pictures and stories were coming together . it 's got together .
of course , the stories that i was going to come out of : `` oh , '' `` blah , '' and `` hmm . ''
in `` upwake , '' i was able to use my way to get around the computer and put it with my neck .
so , sort of , both of these two passions .
something interesting happened at `` upwake , '' which is to solve a nuclear problem in this film -- and we had to solve this kind of liquid steel , and we put it in suspended animation ,
and what was going to do was first , first , first , the first cloned towers , which ever in a movie .
the film made no money , but he was just playing his own , but i realized something fascinating : the audience on the whole world was like a magic of the magic that 's taken off .
according to love arthur 's law of law , you know , you know , you ca n't solve technology 's technology , and it does n't seem
so you saw something magic .
and that 's what i thought to be fascinating .
and i thought , `` wow , this must be used to be used in this way . ''
so we went to `` two 2 , '' the next movie , a lot more .
together , together , we put it up with water , and we put the guy out of hot metal . it was a lot of how the effect was going to be .
and it worked . and the effect in the audience was the same one . we 've done a little bit more money .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was a whole new world of creativity .
and so i started a company , along with my good friend , who was at the first time of the best , and she 's got , she was called `` studio . ''
so , the idea of this company was to begin to explore the current molecular process with a mechanical memory , and in addition to the same time .
and so we did , and we did , and we looked at these times a day .
but in the 1990s of the 1990s , we realized that we were in the ministry of shop and we asked -- we actually had the company -- too slowly .
and i had this piece of paper called `` call '' which i want to hear the mermaid in love of visual effects and to be effects in the whole new dimension of human human , including characters that were made by the world . and the world should be
but the people started pretty good . and people in my company told me that we were not able to be able to be able to do that .
so i started doing this , and i put this piece of film over this big ship that 's going on .
and i said , `` and i bought a ship in a ship . '' it turned into a local treatment , a little film .
but actually , i really wanted to come to the real way of the titanic .
so that 's why i made the film .
that 's the truth . the studio did n't know that .
but i did n't know , i said , `` we 're going to go to the bus . we 're looking at the real building .
we 're going to show it in the video of the movie .
it 's really important . it 's a good thing for marketing . ''
and i urge them to give a nuclear weapon .
sounds crazy . but this is back to your own sense of reality .
and we actually created six months later a reality where i went in a russian store four miles underneath the surface of the north atlantic , and i put the real picture of a bow .
this was not a film , not a sign , that was real .
so that really changed me .
and the beauty of these things were enormous , and we had to put cameras and build them and everything else .
and i noticed , how much of these reactors , of course , of course .
well , they were also dancing , and they write a company .
you 're going to go into these blocks , and you 're in this dark dark , horizontal environment , where do n't have hope , if you ca n't do it .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's the same thing as if i 'm in a movie .
that 's really cool . ''
i was actually obsessed with the deep ocean .
anyway , the part that was involved with curiosity and science , it was all . it was painful , it was curiosity . it was kind of a sense .
and it was an experience that i could n't afford to hollywood .
because , you know , i was able to make a living way that we could then make a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i would see outside of the window .
and in some of the following you 've seen , i 've seen creatures of myself , and sometimes things that i 've never seen before , sometimes things that have n't seen before , and for the science at the time , when we saw them , had n't been
so it really got to me , and i wanted to do .
and so , i got an interesting decision .
after the success of `` jeopardy '' , i said , `` okay , i 'm going to take my bike back to ice and i 'm going to spend for a while . ''
and then we started , we went back to the cloud , and they would match me .
we went back to the edge of the titanic .
we took small robots that we built , which is a clean .
our intent was to go and look at the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
nobody had ever been able to put the inside of the system , and you did n't have the resources . so we developed the technology .
so , and i 'm sitting there , on the side of the titanic , in a shoe and see , and see , these are pretty much like this , and i know that once the band was played there .
and i walk with a little bit of wire through the windows of the ship .
but i just sort of just a picture of it , but my consciousness is within the car .
it felt like i was living into the scene of the jungle .
this was the most beautiful form of a woman that i 've ever experienced , because before i walk around around a corner , i knew that i had always been seeing what was going on in the back of the plane , because i had gone over
the set was to be just an accurate copy of the play of the ship .
so that was a pretty profound experience .
and she also made me this dilemma that you would use that you 're going to use to use this game , and sort of consciousness in the car , in that different form of existence .
it was really quite amazing .
and perhaps , perhaps , a little bit of a sense of what might happen in a few decades , when you 've got trained to explore something or other things , in all kinds of music that i can do as a
so , after this satellite , we began what we saw down there , which is really obvious , for instance , for example , these things , where we 've been seeing these incredibly , incredibly , but here on earth .
they live with help .
they do n't exist in an area of the sun as we do .
and so you see animals that can sit right next to a 500 degree c that you can survive .
and at the same time , i was very interested in my head , which was the home of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who were interested in space , and they 're talking to nasa and they 're in and right , right , and let 's go for russia , and they 're going to travel to russia , and we 're going to
that was fascinating .
but at the end of it , it was on the end , that i was going to take up to the deep sea .
i took them up with them , and i gave them access to the world on top of the world : `` oops , '' , people , people who were interested in these extreme situations , i took them to the sources , so they could move around , and they
however , we used to do that , but actually science , but actually science , in particular , frankly .
so the circle between my existence as a musician , as a child , and the difference in reality .
so , in the process of this research , i 've learned a lot .
now , i 've learned a lot about science , but i think you certainly do now , you know , can be a state , a leader , a leader .
but i do n't understand a lot of leadership , before i 'm using these apps .
because at some point , i had to say , `` what am i here ?
why do i do that ? what comes out of ? ''
and then , these guys make us bring a money .
we 're just going to play the atmosphere again . there 's no data coming down .
all i think i was going to `` `` '' and '' `` `` '' '' and i put the way on a foot on the beach .
i 've got all of these films , and this is a very small audience .
not a musician , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
you 're doing it for the job of the challenge , and the ocean is the largest environment that you 're doing , you 're doing it for it , and because of the spirit connection , what if a small group of people
because we have all this with only 10 or 12 people around for years , and sometimes we were two to three months earlier .
and in that community , you realize that the most important thing is that you have in front of you , because you have a task that you can tell no other things .
if you go back to land , and you say , `` we had to do it , the lights , and the whole thing , all the technology , and the trouble in terms of the human model , then you ca n't tell
there 's a connection , a standard respect .
so when i first started to make my next film `` brain , i tried to use the same framework , which is that you could get to find your team in it , and it feels in love of mind .
it has changed the dynamic changes .
and so i stood up with a small team at a logarithmic field , and we used `` model '' with a new technology that has n't existed before .
it 's really exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were for a period of four years at a time family .
it changed my way , films , completely .
there were people who said that , we thought those were really good at this place , and we 've got the same planet .
for me , it was more than me to do with my job , to do the actual process that changed the result .
so , what can we learn from all of this ?
what do we learn ?
i think it really felt curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the use of your team is more important than all the world of the world .
and then to come to me , young , who said , `` give me an advice of how i can do it . ''
and i say , `` no man do n't .
there 's some other things for you . do n't tell you to yourself , not for yourself , but take risks on itself . ''
so nasa has become an astronaut : `` no failure is not an alternative . ''
but in art , if you need to be an alternative , because there is a service .
it 's not important , the innovation , has been no risk .
you have to be willing to take this risks .
that 's the idea that i want to leave you with the way it is that it 's good one , but it 's not . thank you .
now i 'm talking about energy and climate .
and that might be surprising , because my work for the foundation is mainly about how much people are doing , and the things that we need to create , and need to make the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually , in fact , in fact more important than the planet for any other on the planet .
in fact , what that does n't grow up in a lot of years , we 're going to eat too much , and things are going to change the way that ca n't be able to do so .
that leads to e . it leads to uncertainty . it leads .
so , it 's going to be a mostly quality of you .
and also , it 's really important for them .
the fact is , if you could only go from one thing that price you would be a price of energy , it was a energy at all .
well , the dance has over time .
in fact , that 's what we 're going to do .
they 've come to the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a place in the room room , and that 's why we 've been doing , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we 're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we price the price -- let 's take a price -- we 're going to come to a new cave and that liquid light on carbon .
co2 is the planet , and the point of co2 is actually pretty clear .
it 's made the four of carbon that 's taken into this , and it has some very subtle effects , which is the weather , and perhaps worse worse , that suggests that the natural effect that have n't been able to have
well , the same relationship between a violin and how to make toast , and where the other consequences are , there are some of them , but not quite many .
and there 's certainly a lot of things about how bad this will follow . but they 're going to be extremely bad .
i asked her two times , `` are we really need to get down here ?
do n't we have half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we get near zero , the temperature will continue .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a distributed feet high on the air , which is one of the three feet of a foot , and that 's very much different than to say , you know , we 've got a clean feet high on the top of the
this has to go down to down to zero .
well , we 're going to take a lot of it every year , over 3,000 billion tons .
everybody 's about 20 tons , people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it 's about five tons of every planet .
and somehow , we need to change changes . it 's zero to zero .
it 's been close up there .
there 's only different economic changes in all the world , and we 've got to go down from debt to market and to a market price to zero .
this equation has four factors . it 's a little bit awkward . they have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that they want to move to zero , and that 's going to spread from the number of people , all the human being on average ,
so let 's look at risk every single day , and we 'll think about how we can get that down .
probably one of these numbers must be very close to zero .
now this is kind of basic , but let 's go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , 1.3 billion people .
and it 's going to move to nine billion to nine billion .
if we very successful with new kinds of wood , which we 're going to be cold and we 're going to , we 're going to take that down to 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we 're going to see a population increase with a population .
the second factor is the services we use .
this is all the food that we eat , clothing , television .
these are very good things , and they 're willing to provide these services for everyone on the planet .
it 's great news .
in the rich world , in the top of a billion billion , we may be able to be able to do more and less use , but on average , that number a year , and more than half more than the price
so , here 's a very important thing . is it home lights so you can read your homework ?
and these students , they do n't go , so they go , and they 're reading their notes under their mouths .
well , at efficiency , the average , the energy per service , there 's some good news .
we have something that 's not going up .
because of the traditional success of foreign media , through others , through new methods , there are lots of services that are growing up in the base of different services by 90 percent .
in other places , like how do you take from the board of fuel -- you 've got to make a service or a tooth or a cold or a cold , it 's a lot of smaller for a lot of a lot of small .
in fact , if we 're optimistic , we 'll get an increase by a factor or maybe it 's a factor .
but the first three factors , we 're now at the age of a billion billion maybe two billion tons , and that 's not enough .
so let 's look at the fourth factor -- and this one is going to be a source -- that 's the amount of co2 that is going to be developed .
it turns out whether you can get it to zero .
when they feed coal , no .
if you burn organic tumors , no .
almost every carbon footprint for electricity is co2 from electricity , except in terms of renewables .
so , what we need to do on a global scale is to create a new system .
we need them .
now , if i use the term of wonder , i do n't mean that .
it 's a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the internet , and the internet , of course , is a miracle
people here have become the development of these miracles .
usually , there is no doubt that you need a miracle to a certain conclusion .
usually , you 're just going to be able to go back and some of you , others not .
in this case , we also have to go , and have a miracle at very short time .
well , i was like , how can i do that ?
is there a natural disconnect , a subject which is the notion of people here ?
i remembered that last year when i turned around and i kind of liked people .
and the idea was to look for them , and you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
and for energy , i noticed this .
i decided that the ritual of cotton was going to be my life for the environment .
so , here are some of these grains of sand .
you have told me that you do n't show you , and in fact , you do n't think of that glass .
well , there 's all kinds of things like this , but they do n't make a lot of it .
we need solutions , or either one , or some of the ones who have developed a unique range , and we have a unique set of time , and there 's a lot of ways that people are looking for people for people , and i really see five who can do
i 've got me , android , potassium and amjad .
this may be a good if you do better than i expect , and if you do better as i expect it , that would be great , but my favorite key here is that we have to work in all those work , and we can not give them any of them because they
so let 's look at the fossil state of fossil fuels , reduce oil or natural gas .
what you have to do there is maybe simple , but it 's not . you want to be all of the co2 that comes up from the air , and you get under pressure and then go somewhere in there .
there are some characters that are going to grow up at a 60 percent -- 80 percent of the world , but it 's about 100 percent , it 's going to be extremely difficult , and there 's a place for making the carbon
who will make it ?
who can make a difference , what do a lot of billions times bigger than any kind of waste that you can think of yourself and other things ?
that 's a lot .
so that 's kind of hard .
next thing : april .
it has three big problems , and the cost , especially in its countries are up high . the question is that you really feel that if you really can go wrong , despite the human drug that the fuel is used for weapons .
and what do you do with that ?
because although it 's not very large , there 's a lot of things .
so , there are three very difficult problems that might be made , and that 's why you should work with that .
so , the last three of five i 've been put in .
these are the renewables you 're going to be called .
and again , though it 's great , it 's that they do n't need a fuel -- they have a couple of them .
to one , the production technologies , which is the technologies of these technologies are significantly lower than they are .
these are diatoms , you 're talking about a lot of 140 , a thousand times more than a normal body .
and also , these tools go to follow these sources .
the sun does n't seem like the whole day , and it does n't seem to fall either every day , and it does n't always go to the wind as well .
and therefore , you have to go from these sources of these sources , you have a road , you have energy energy when you 're not available .
so , there 's a great deal here . there 's challenges at all of the waste , and when we say , for example , that the energy region outside of the country , you do n't need the technology , you do n't just have the technology , you have to
and there 's the nest .
and to show that what i 've done , i 've been all kinds of vehicles that are being made , and you know , the way that you use cars , computers , cell phones , everything for everything , and that 's what i 've done with the amount of
so what we need here is a big trend , something that 's going to be going to be going to be a factor than the time .
it 's not impossible , but it 's not that easy .
this is what happens when you try and you 've got these open sources over the 20 percent -- 30 percent of the world 's life .
if you want to use 100 percent of it , you need an incredible set of reference .
well , where we should go , what is the right approach ?
one is called the dark project ? how are we going to come ?
what we need is a lot of companies that are working on this .
in each of these five areas we need to have at least 100 people .
you 'll say , they 're crazy ! that 's good .
i believe here in the ted group , there are many numbers that are already there .
bill 's the big companies , among the other one , which is the great slate .
in addition , invest in groups companies make great things , and interesting opportunities , and i 'm trying to support that .
countless websites , and i use a company , which , perhaps , is a nuclear approach .
there 's a couple of innovation in this -- that 's -- like , liquid .
the development has been a few time in this industry , so it 's not great surprise to have some good ideas .
and what they means is that instead , you instead instead of a part of the year one , one percent , which is , we decided to increase the 99 percent .
it 's a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you 've been thinking about it a long time , but you could never kind of wonder about it , whether it would work , but then , since all , modern , you can see it and look at that , yes , yes , yes !
and because you 're using this 99 percent , it 's a lot better .
in fact , if you put a diet , and you can actually use the use of use of technology as a service .
instead of it , instead it 's easy , just a great thing .
so , that 's what 's produced by using tissue , a little bit like a drum .
you can see that it 's a kind of a hierarchy , often a kind of a wave .
this is really what 's going to do .
here 's a picture of a life in rotterdam .
that 's the waste food , which is 99 percent . you 've got the whole part of it , so it 's called it 's liquid .
that 's the u.n. population for hundreds of years .
and if you 're going to grow up enough , and you 're going to get it , you get enough carbon for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come forward .
let 's think about how we should make our success success .
what should we look like ?
well , let 's go to the end that we need to do , and then we 'll talk about them .
a lot of the talks from a 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it 's really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent are going to be produced in poor countries , still in the poor countries , still have to run a food system , and hopefully it 's going to be clean and clean up to that .
so , in order to reach this 80 percent , you 've got to have the developed countries , including countries like china , your transportation completely dramatically .
the other story says whether we use the technology technology , whether it 's used in all of the developed countries , and we 're on the way to get them in the rest .
that 's great important .
this is going to have a network of this system .
so if we were going to go back and what was going to look like this year ?
it should make the two elements .
we need to use the contract to grow up in the way , and the less us , the less will be that they 're going to be , and it 's also the temperature .
but in fact , this is true for the things that we do , which is not entirely to the big bang , just in the same way , or even slightly less important than the others , which is the basis of innovation for these
and we 've got to do that kind of thing that we need to do with these systems , and we can measure them , and that 's what we can measure : in
there are lots of great books in this topic .
the al gore wrote , `` we have the choice , '' and david said , `` clean energy in the air air . ''
you 're going to go through it , and create an object in which this is going to be very large , because we need for support of all sides .
there 's a couple of things that come together .
that 's a wish .
a very often wish that we developed this technology .
if you just wish me a wish for the next 50 years , i could find the president , you know , you know , and that 's what i love , or i could , you know , i could take this wish that 's
this has the biggest impact .
if we 're not going to get that wish , we will go between the long time and the next day of people , and the united states and china , between poor and rich countries , and almost all of the life of those two billion are going to be
so , what do we do ?
so , for what i am doing ?
we need to use it for more purposes .
if countries are living in places like `` well , '' they should not just talk about co2 .
they want to go to these graphs , and they would be used to be a little bit of a little bit of the fun who 's going to be working on this tool .
we 're going to use carbon , carbon force , clean water system makes something that 's creating .
we need to get the message .
we 've got to participate , and we 're doing it , and also the things that are done by the government .
it 's a big wish , but i think we can make it .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just to understand something better -- is : first , can you give us a notion of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : so , in order to do the simulation of a collaborative system , all of the big scientists have to get out what we 've done , we only need a few million , and even if we combine our materials into a number of these materials in order to make sure that it works ,
and the hard step is to find these first , another billion , and the place that 's in the place .
once the first is done , if he 's like me , it 's all because , because the economic economy , the production of it is so different than when we know .
now , to understand that , this is going to be deep in the ground to build a kind of a mixture of nuclear government , and that includes it , and then it starts to the process , and it goes down to the bottom ?
bg : exactly . today , you 've got to put it in the oceans , so there 's a lot of people , and there are a lot of people who can go wrong . this thing is where you put it up and stuff it
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can produce it for 60 years -- you think of a sudden -- that you 're going to go through , not all the way .
and it 's sitting there , and it 's 60 years long , and it 's finished .
and one of them who 's a solution for breast cancer .
bg : yeah . well , what happens with the food : you can make it -- there 's a lot less waste with this -- then you take it and put it in the next and on it .
and we 're starting by using the waste that we already , who already exists , which is in these galleries or in charge , that 's our home .
so this was what it was a problem for what it was to be a problem , what we 're going to be in our pockets , and this is going to have the more dramatic process that 's happening during this process .
but while they deal with different people in this world as well .
where is the biggest interest of interest in this ?
bg : so now we 're not going to have a place , and there 's a lot more interesting than anything that is called `` cancer '' in name , and there 's a big interest in russia , and the people of the company were in russia , india , china -- i was here , and
so , i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese did something .
this is a sequence of one thing that was done .
that 's an important step forward , but it 's like a cell cell , and some countries built that built , so that 's every one that has developed a divided for our first .
in their sense , for instance , and what would seem like to be in the life ?
bg : well , we need one of these things , things that are very cheap , for 20 years , and then 20 years to do it .
and this is kind of what we call , which is what we call the most visible thing that we have to anticipate .
and , you know , they , if everything is good , and it 's a big wish . it might be easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of companies , and we need hundreds of them , and the way that their work work , that can work for their jobs to be able to do that .
and it would be best if there are going to be multiple , because then you could use a structure .
we need a solution .
so , there 's a lot of big phenomena , is this one that you know ?
bg : a monster is the most glamorous .
it would have been without the power , but it 's so much more important .
in the for-profit sector , there are other companies that are there .
you know , we do n't know the work as well as this , but there 's a mental method that 's another approach .
so , there 's a traffic pump that 's kind of hard , but maybe they 'll say that that 's about us .
and so there 's a lot of different , but the nice thing is , that if you give a million times so much energy , like one , we say , you know , and that 's why you deal with the problems , and
if that does n't work , what ?
do we have to have a trained to try to maintain the debt ?
bg : if you come to this situation , it 's like you have too much , and it 's about a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a tax or a .
there 's a force called that , which is used to deal with various techniques to reduce climate warming , so that we 20 to 20 or 30 years more likely to make us .
this is just a shock .
you hope we need that .
some people say , you should n't really do n't just work on your insurance because you do n't have the likely to do it , so you keep food , because you know that you should be going to save the rescue .
i do n't know if it 's smart , if you look at the importance of this problem , but there 's a sort of research going on where you should have done that , if things come faster , or it 's a long longer than we expect .
tbp : do you have any or two sentences for the ones that you might need to ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the russians were in very different town .
those who are doing science , they 're very little .
do you think that there is any negative impact that you have to do with the clouds , things are going to change things ?
there are very , very few things you can tell , which is a chance in a million .
this is something like it 's done .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it very much later .
and therefore , the idea , now , if you have all sorts of information problems in something that you 're starting to do when -- and that 's the investment of the investment , in fact , that 's not exactly the worst level , and there are people in the rich world that
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us care .
but my dream here is , if you can do it , and at the same time , then you 'll say , `` okay , i 'm not sure it 's not carbon carbon , i wish i really wish that it would do that , but i 'm going to
and that would be an answer that would have been based on the conventional word argument that if you use all of these time and energy , you use the co2 problem , and you can solve it , all the other aspects of malaria and so on , that there 's a
bg : well , the real amount of research -- say , the u.s. military should spend 10 billion dollars than they do today -- that 's not so sustainable .
we should not suffer other things .
you go to great , and you can see people 's nice people , if you have something that 's not economic , and that 's trying to support that . for me , most of the waste .
it 's because , you know , you 're very short , and i 'm just just going to do the math problem , and i think we should do more things that have the potential to be a lot more cheaper .
if you 're in charge you 're very high , then you can do the rich .
i mean , each of us here is five times as much as our energy work without changing its lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion , it 's a disaster .
and even a conversation , think about it .
his new yorker is now , `` why is n't it more serious research ? ''
he 's still going to go out of that , because of his previous stories , he 's a bit , but he understood that that 's a very precious group , and that 's why he 's now going to do that .
and this is a place i think of healing .
the research , it 's just crazy , how little people will get .
bill , i do n't think i 'm going to talk about all of the people here when i say , i really hope for your wish . thank you .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , in peter , peter 's called a album called `` the tempest . ''
and the idea is pretty simple . you 've got to go to the largest largest structure with 20 degrees , 10 degrees , and it 's quite simple .
the third has to be on top .
and , although it 's really easy , it 's actually really hard because it 's very difficult to people , because it 's very difficult to work .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i put it into a concert .
it was a huge success .
since then , i 've been about 70 percent of the world , with students , musicians and architects , even with the research , and there 's something about this task , which is to create its knowledge in nature , and i want to share some of it with you
however , most people are concerned about themselves .
you talk about it , you 're going to think about what it is going to look like .
they invest a little bit of planning in planning and organization , and they provide it , and they accumulate .
they 're spending a lot of their time into the space of the space .
and finally , just before you do n't have time anymore , someone takes your dog and you put them on the top , and you step back back and `` do n't . '' she 's your job .
but then , almost always , it 's like the `` lean '' `` `` '' '' to become a `` tooth , '' because the weight of the tissue is the whole thing that 's going to be honest .
there 's a range of people who have a lot more `` job , '' than others , and under the worst they 're fresh .
they lie , they 're confused , they 're confused , and they make really cool structures .
and of course , there 's a lot of kids who 've done a lot more at the time , and are among the best ones in the place .
and it 's quite amazing .
like us , peter said , she does n't just look at the highest but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking , how is that ? why ? what about those ?
and peter said , `` you know , none of the children will be used to be used to be a player . ''
they do n't invest in time .
but there 's another reason .
and that was , for instance , they got one right plan , ok .
and it seems to realize .
what happens when you put in the top at the top , they do n't have time more time , and what happened ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what 's going to do is that you start working with the tower , build a building of prototypes , always at the end of the dog , so that they were able to create the ability to create a complete prototype .
in addition , we see this kind of collaboration as a core of a primate .
and with each time , the children will tell you what works and what does n't .
so it 's the power of working with prototypes , but we see it 's kind of like a lot of engineers .
the average for most of you are at the average of it is about , you know , you 've got half of those , you know , a little bit more , but it 's not much , you 're better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
it 's the first thing you 've seen .
and why ? because they are able to understand and distributed maps patterns are the key to build build structures .
they 're about average . but here 's interesting interesting .
you know , you have a nuclear leader on the team , you 'll make a lot better .
it 's amazing . you see , you know , `` this team is going to win . ''
you can predict that . why is that ?
because they have special skills .
they come together , they understand it .
and that team , which , of course , is going to make the power of a very small trend .
we have more skills and getting their process of success .
but if you have 10 teams , the typical economy , you get about six , who have developed structures .
so i tried to do something very interesting .
and i thought , well , let 's take a look at this .
so i bought a $ $ price of software for the press .
what do you think about this ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a heavy structure .
if anyone had a big high web built , it would have taken the price off .
so is n't it interesting that have a powerful effect ?
we had this training with the same students .
what happened ?
now , they understood the advantage of the `` bossy . ''
so , from the same , bad team of one of the best .
they are growing up the highest in all the time .
so , there 's so much lessons for us about nature and success .
you may ask , why would someone actually make time for a factory ?
and the reason is , i create digital tools and creating processes to enable our own cars , cars , play video games and `` make furniture . ''
and what it does is , it helps them to identify these patterns .
because , frankly , every project has its own family .
the challenge of an shared experience , a common language , is to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested can come up in .
it 's a blog where you can see how to make the flow .
there 's a line there .
you 're going to find crazy examples from all over the world , like people , and the system .
there are also beetles .
and the most exciting lesson , i think , is the network of a system .
we all have our ability to work on the problem , and that we use our way to use our way to our emotions and what we do , in the challenge that is happening .
and sometimes it 's a little prototype of this experience , which it takes us from a `` tooth , '' to a `` tooth '' moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
so we 've got a machine here like this .
a big machine , a cool , open machine machine , and that 's a furniture scene .
and everybody in this room has to be in this room .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you ca n't sit in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i 've given my friends at last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i do n't know . they were going back before , before there were cars , or twitter , or `` america 's looking for the human . ''
i do n't know .
i mean , you kind of become a way to go into a process .
and that 's what i understand .
i 'm not part of that group , i have to say .
i do n't want to go into the past , and not because i 'm a fan .
it 's because there 's not going back on this planet , you go ahead .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the most exciting time we 've ever done on this planet , no matter what it means : health , wealth , wealth , wealth , financial , financial .
there was never before a time like this .
my grandfather died when they were 60 .
my grandparents was that number to 70 percent .
my parents are 80 on top of these guys .
so it should be better at the beginning of my apartment .
but it 's not like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who is now born in new york as long as the richest man in the world , 100 years ago .
think about it . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox : smallpox people have billion people on this planet .
they 've gone to a way in a way that has no war ever .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we 've got them . spray .
in the rich world , there is a disease that millions of us have ever heard before , right ?
open , gobble , cookie ...
does anybody ever know what that is ?
environmental modern , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that 's the successes of scientific technology .
and from my perspective , the science method , see if it works , it works , if it does n't do that , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , that 's the good good news , because there 's a couple of other problems , and you 've seen a lot .
and one of them is that despite all of our grandchildren a billion people in this world every day .
these numbers are going up , and they 're going to go very quickly , and that 's a mess .
and not only that , we 've used our imagination to make this world a world .
drinking , water land , water oil , oil , gas , and that 's soon , and if we do n't make it from this chaos .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
and i think it 's clear that we can produce food that 's billions billion people , without the land they live in .
i think we can take this world with energy that you do n't fall at the same time .
i do n't believe that , and no , this is not a contradiction .
but this is what 's called me at night -- one of the things that night me at night , and we 've got moral progress here as well as well as well .
and we 've never been able to make it as well as we can .
we 're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many places , and yet i think we 've got hundreds to hundreds of thousands of years before the world has gone back in order to find a period where we have progress , where we 've talked about these things about these things ,
people are in their thinking , and they feel so deeply they ca n't take it .
it 's not even the truth of it .
and listen , everybody has got a good thing to think , even the right thing in its opinion .
but you know what you 're not right ?
they do n't have right to their own facts , they do n't have them .
and i 've had a while trying to figure out this .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about `` the new yorker , '' a little article .
and i was thrilled to find a lot of resistance , a lack of resistance , which is the most effective in public health in health care of humanity .
i did n't know what to do , so i just did n't know what i was doing , and i wrote an article , and i went on .
and soon i wrote an article about changing food food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people played crazy .
so , i 've wrote writing about this article , and i could n't understand why people thought that would be `` tooth , '' that they believed that a certain way to a random kind of a random kind of light form
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the articles . i wrote the article .
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
we go , we 're going to eat , we eat food , that 's okay .
but this article made me , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually i found it .
and that 's because these things that really did n't look at me was n't being fired .
these were people people , people folks , people prefer people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that made me so ...
but then i thought , you know what , if we 're honest .
we are at the point where we do n't have the same relationship for progress as well .
we 're talking about .
we 're talking about , we 're talking with little letters : `` progress . ''
okay , for some reason , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have the trust in institutions , in politics , and sometimes , in all of the science , and there 's no reason why that should n't be .
you can just hear a few names , and people will understand .
curiosity , dance , the sales , gobble , indians , the german 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can make your own list .
there are more questions and problems with people that we thought they were going to be right . so , so , do n't know .
ask these questions , they pay evidence , they need them .
do n't take anything than that .
but here 's it : if you 've got evidence , you 've got to believe that evidence , and we 're not good at it .
and i can tell that for the reason that we are now in a nuclear fear of fear , which i 've never seen before , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a horrible story , which is a prosthetic story that has been done with the ministry of water , and led to a media .
very scary .
so , the recent studies were starting to see if that was true .
the other studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from canada , from canada , and they were all the same , no force , no connection , no one .
it makes no difference . it does n't make any difference , because we believe in psychology , we think what we see is that we can feel really comfortable .
we do n't think about a blank video that 's given us , and i understand that , i think we 're all .
but do you know what ?
the result of that was a little bit .
because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the food chain for malaria .
that 's a great thing , and we should be ashamed .
it 's terrible .
what happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do that .
because does anybody get here ?
is there an one on the audience who see someone who die die ?
and not very often often .
this country , at this country , at all , is n't going to be around the world last year .
that 's a lot of death by sheep , 20 per hour .
but because that 's not what 's not here , we 're going to do it , and we can use people like herbie , and we 're talking about fear and messages of fear and the beaches of sites like the ages and the prime minister of king 's face .
and they can do it because they do n't cause and change .
they do n't understand that these things seem to be as well , but almost never do the same thing .
and this is something that we need to learn , and it 's very quickly .
this guy was a hero , sir .
it invites us from one of the worst of humanity 's worst .
no fear , no survivor , gobble , gobble .
the guy in the middle of the middle in the middle of the middle .
he 's called david .
he has just developed a few other people .
he can live with the lives of every year children per year in the developing world .
pretty well , not ?
well , that 's good , besides , that paul talks and talk about biology and says how valuable they are , and that people should stop stop .
and that 's actually what he says .
so paul is a japanese .
when paul comes in a public crowd talk , he ca n't talk to speak about it .
he gets chocolate at home because people would tell him that they know where they 're going to school .
and why ? because paul made an operation .
now , i do n't need to say that , but i do n't need to say , but
if you take them on , let the disease go back , terrible diseases , and this is happening .
we 've now turned in this country .
and that 's going to be worse , and quite soon , kids will die again because it 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not going to die to die .
what is the problem ? let 's take it . why not ?
and i said , one of them wrote me a few weeks ago , and i said , i think i 'm a little bit too .
nobody ever ever said before .
you would n't have your child to hold your child .
harmony .
why ? because we do n't have disposable and know what ?
we did n't even have the country in this country .
today , i do n't know , you know , that 's a morning somebody in going to go to an airplane and just go to los angeles , at the moment he 's in the moment .
and then in a few hours , he goes and have a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's going to have one of that poster 's going to go back to the evening .
and he does n't know that the way he 's designed with a common illness , and we do n't know that , because the world works now .
that 's the planet we live . do n't do it as if it does n't .
we love it to fall down . we love this .
do you have all taken up the same morning ?
so , you know , a little bit of water that 's going to show you .
i know that they did that , because half of the americans make it every day .
you take the stuff , and you take alternative , and it does n't make any difference , how often we find that you are useless .
the data starts all over .
they accumulate their toes . they never do .
that 's okay , so you want to take a million billion dollars on the dark charge .
i thank you completely .
dark ones . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do it ?
well , i do n't think i understand -- we do hate the food .
we hate it too strong government . we do n't have trust the system .
and we should n't , and we should n't . our health care system is .
it 's toxic to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold , and it 's actually a little self to us .
so we go away , and where are we going ?
we 're running into the poor of the kitchen .
that 's great . i love the gun .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because it 's all about it , and we 're going to spend billions of dollars .
and i 've got all kinds of little boxes here .
none of them -- oops , steel , shelter , aids , i do n't even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars in it ; it 's gone .
and you know what ? when i say that , people look at me and say , `` what are you going to do ? let people do what they want .
so feel good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it does n't care about whether it 's health , which says , `` oh , i 'm not going to buy the math of my youth , '' or not who are who wants to do a patient with their patients .
if you 're going to go to this way , where you believe and magic and science , you get to a place where you do n't want to be .
they come up to the basic institute of south africa .
he was brought in front of his people , because he was that red open , she was making a lot more effective and much more effective effective than a common health , which we know that they could have taken away from the ground .
hundreds of thousands of deaths of death in a country that is worse than any one of those illness .
do n't tell me that these things do n't have consequences .
they have them . they have always .
well , the institutional epidemic that we 're in , this is the deepest struggle between the motor of the cosmos , and the owner .
it 's a tough debate . it has to stop .
it 's a debate about words , of metaphor .
that 's ideology , not science .
everything that we eat every every , every bacterium , any seed , has changed by humans .
you know , there was n't a breakfast in the hospital .
there was no photoshop .
there was n't any christmas . we 've done this .
we 've done it in the last year years .
and some of it has worked and not .
we 've got rid of what 's not working .
now we can do it more , and , of course , there 's risks , but we can do something like vitamin a car in rice , and the stuff can be millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
do n't you want it ?
i must say , i do n't .
we 're going to physically grow food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i 'm always hearing about is a lot of chemicals , of organic , marketing , toilet , we do n't want to put green fields into one thing that 's wrong .
we do n't want to live lives .
we do n't want to attract seeds .
and you know , what is my answer to this ?
yes , they 're right . we do that .
it 's true , we 've got a huge bear , but that 's not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it 's right , morality , you know .
you know , the science is not a company .
it 's not land .
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it does n't work and sometimes , but the idea that we should do science is to do their work , because we have a real life , and it 's dependent millions of people
you know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to have 70 percent more food than the moment , 70 percent .
this investment in africa has been the last 30 years .
leadership . sorry .
they need that , and we do n't .
and why ? food has changed food .
we do n't want to encourage people to do this stuff stuff , like for example .
what 's happened is that half a billion billion people .
it 's kind of like a statue .
it 's just a handful of calories . it 's painful .
it has no resources , it does n't have any protein , and you 've got all of it to do this .
and then , people could eat , and they would not be blind .
they would n't die , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it would be not dumb , but it would be beautiful .
and all i say to say is : why are we fighting it ?
i mean , let 's ask : why are we doing this ?
because we do n't want to have a family pie ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our romantic passion for marketing , or our weight food , better food , better food .
it 's not about conventional , it 's about giving people alive , and it 's going to get a chance to understand what that means .
because do you know what ?
if we do n't do that , if we continue to do that , how much we do is we feel about something that we do , i do n't want to be hurt .
there is no other description of what 's going on here .
it 's absurd , it 's ugly , it 's not our fault , and we have to do that .
now , in this incredibly funny talk , you might want to say , `` do you want to go and go to that song and go into the future ? ''
in every case , that 's what i want to do .
right now , you 're in the present present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this challenge into what we want .
we can turn them where we want them to , and we 're going to get them where we want .
we have to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the ground and go into the future , we will be happy to do that .
i know we can , and as far as i 'm concerned , it 's something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a period of time , i 've been really interested in love . it may seem like a really interested in interested , because they 're looking at it as i said , `` if a deception , that 's going to be something , if someone is true enough . ''
in other words , in some studies , in some studies , there 's an environmental impact in some studies , and that 's what it is , and it 's just because the person thinks what 's happening with it , or a kind of -- in
a deception is going to be a little bit true , because someone knows that .
so as we understand each other , i want to show you a very fundamental , a simple thing .
and i 'm going to show you how it works , and that 's a trick that has been at least since the 1950s in every room for children .
so , i was inspired him from the barefoot institute of the research institute in the 1970s .
i 'm going to do it for you and then explain .
and then i 'll explain why i 'll explain .
so , look what happens .
that 's what you can study ; my hand you can use .
i 'm going to keep it in the wire . i 'm going to keep it in my own
and i 'll jump my back back .
and to make sure that 's nothing in my head and out of it , and i 'm just going to open my house right here .
so , in this way , you can see that there 's no one time , and as long as i 'm here , as long as i 'm here , it can do n't fit into my neck , or come .
and the goal is quite simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and i 'll hope , if everything is going to be good , it 's going to be broken through my little bit of physical physical .
it actually turns out to the place in the room that i can hear it without that it is warm .
nothing goes into my stomach , or it 's coming , and you can look at it .
morton !
well , that 's a trick that i often often young young kids who are interested in love , because you can learn that much of it when you start looking at it , even though it 's a very simple
probably most of you here in this room , this trick .
he works the following way .
i can hold it in my hand .
i 'm saying i 'm going to open up my way to make sure that 's nothing in my stomach , or it 's a lie .
the reason why i 'm open up is the very secret of the illusion .
so , in the moment , where i 'm sending my hand from you so you see it from the back , it 's moving down this finger here , my skull , just like there , where he was in a position where he was so
great , right ?
there 's someone who 's not a childhood .
so , it 's up here . right .
and when i come down , the finger of the eye position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you do n't know that there are only three steps in the morning : because the mind and the way it 's information is not one , one , two , but
but that 's not what we 're here in here , and then i 'll open my hand .
of course , there 's not going to be there , but not through my body 's body , but by a trick , by my favorite camera , which is now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing i 'm going to do is you get through this movement that your fingers is going back again .
i 'm going to take this hand . and here 's the bedroom .
that 's a trick , you can teach your friends and your neighbor . thank you .
now , what did that deal with that ?
one year ago , i was reading a study that i really had really quite attention .
i 'm not a doctor or a scientist , and that 's why i was an amazing thing .
and it turns out : if you put a piece in the form of a white ball , in the form of an open , it 's just a game , white windows that gives you a particular set effect .
but if you take the shape in which you look for this , for example , in a smaller ball , and you have this blue and you look at a letter on it , and you can actually grow more efficient .
and that is , although none of those are all kinds of stuff -- they 're just doing them .
but a white ball is not as good as a blue ball .
what ? that made me really .
but it turns out that 's not all .
if you take more enough , you are more than going to be more effective than fast .
there 's a handful of sand that are at the bottom of one of the back , and the other red is better than a white tube .
also , the play plays a role .
a woman twice twice , is n't as good as three songs -- i ca n't tell you the exact statistics . i 'm sorry .
but the key thing is ...
that 's also the play of the play .
and the shape is play .
and if you want to have to that , you 've got to get the cat .
right ? so a battery with a furniture -- a pair of a light of a light that you will tell you a patient .
it makes a very powerful image in your mind . it 's much more powerful than a white ball .
this graph is really -- i 'm going to show you a different time when we have a telephone .
so in fact , the white does n't look as good as the blue ball , which does n't look as good as a way that does n't feel as good as the mouth .
and none of it has really been all of this , it 's only our belief in which we can make a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic machine .
i 'm going to take something that is obviously a deception , and i 'm going to look at it .
so we know what we know from the study is that you have to take a needle when it comes to the thing .
this is a 18 day long , she 's very , very awkward . and i 'm going to show you a little bit .
and this is really my meat . it 's not necessarily special , natural independent meat .
this is my skin . it 's not a rocket image of hollywood .
so i 'm going to take this needle in my skin and through it , and it 's going on the other side to the other side .
if you get sick , you know , if you put yourself in the same way -- i 've got a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some of the people i did n't know , and this has become a
so i 'm going to suggest if you 're going to get bored , you look for the next 30 seconds , or you know what , i 'm going to do the first thing part here .
you can see it in the same way , but you can also see if you want .
so , it goes , right here where my body is going on , i 'm just going to make a little bow .
i 'm really sorry . does it crazy crazy ?
and just a little bit of me through my skin and on the other side .
now , we 're actually in the same situation that we 've been doing when we had a telephone .
it 's about .
but now , you ca n't have my finger , right ?
so , i 'm going to show you . this is one , two , three , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , `` okay , that 's not so stupid , and you 're holding the skin just for us a few minutes . ''
well , i 'll show you .
what is that here ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people say , `` okay . i have n't seen this . ''
the people in the clinic come in .
so let me just show you out of that .
this is really my skin . it 's not a big map of hollywood .
that 's my meat , and i can manipulate this .
i 'm sorry . if you get sick , look away , do n't look .
the people back at the back , which , at some point , at some point , will say , `` well , that 's kind of cool , but if it really was true , he would -- you see , there 's a hole and there
okay , so let me take a little blood for you .
yes , here it is .
now , usually , i would love the needle .
i 'm going to use my arm and show you that there are no foot .
but i think , in this context , i think , with the purpose of being a real person , i 'm going to put the stick in there and go from the stage .
we 're going to look at the next few days .
i hope you 'll look at it . thank you very much .
everyone is talking about happiness .
i 've met some people on the number of books that have been done with `` the `` '' '' in the title in the last five years , and they went up to about 40 years , and there was a lot more .
there 's a massive wave of success of happiness among researchers .
there 's a lot of hype .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these grains of work , there 's a couple of different behaviors that make kind of almost impossible to think of happiness .
and my talk today , mainly , is mainly from the memory memory .
so , that 's true for action , which is about your good happiness , and it 's true for scientists to think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just as common as any other .
so the first of this game is an interactive , complexity .
it turns out that the word of happiness is simply not an intelligent word , because we do it in a lot of different things .
i think there 's a certain kind of meaning we could do it , but in large , and all of that is something that we 'll need to , and we 'll have to look at the complicated perspective , which is what well-being is .
the second one is to do a function of experience and memory : basically , it 's between happy to live in your life and be happy , and be happy in your life , or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they are both of them in the idea of happiness .
and the third is that , and that 's the only thing that we ca n't think about a sense of thinking , which is affected without its meaning .
i mean , that 's a real sense .
there is just no way to get it right .
now , i 'd like to take with an example of someone who had a conversation after one of my students in history .
and then it goes down , really , really , really powerful , that has experience the experience of experience .
but it did n't .
what it was like was the memory of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of love for 20 minutes .
it does n't work because it was using a memory of memory , which was memory , and it was all that memory was all he got .
what really tells us that we can think about other people in the sense of two species of the self .
there 's a family self , which is happening in the present and the present , and it 's possible to experience the past again , but basically just the present .
it 's the stigma itself , the doctor 's doctor -- you know , when the doctor asks , `` do it feel better if i do it here ? ''
and then you have a joint self , and the driver itself is that , and the story of your life is going to be , and it 's in the face that 's the doctor 's physician , `` how did you have the last time ? ''
or , `` what was your journey for me ? ''
so , these are two very different entities , but that includes itself , and that is what you call it is part of the word of happiness .
well , the thing itself is a storyteller .
and it really starts with a basic reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately immediately .
we do n't tell just stories about when we 're doing stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is , what we 're going to continue to continue to our work is a story .
and let me start with an example .
there 's an old study .
these are the real patients who are attracted to grow a hard time .
i 'm not going to go into the details . it 's not more painful , but it was painful when this trial was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report in their own two seconds .
and these are two patients . these are the ones .
and they 're going to ask , `` who has got more of these two ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient 's given clear more and its home has been longer , and every minute of pain , the patient 's patient has had to b , and more .
but now there 's another question : `` how do those patients you need ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient 's a , a lot of forced to college , as a patient .
the stories of the wild were different , and because a very fundamental part of the story is how it ends up .
and none of these stories is a very controversial or a great thing -- but one of them is clear ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the one that was worse , where the pain was at the end of its peak , it 's a terrible story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people what they were asked , and they said , `` how bad was all of this stuff ? ''
and she was a lot worse for a b for b .
well , this is a social conflict between itself itself , and it 's a dream .
from the point of the year itself , it 's a wonderful time .
now , what you could do with a patient and we did have done a clinical experiments , and we 've done a clinical experiments , and it 's been done , and it 's working , you 're actually going to get the ability of a patient in order to keep
this is going to make the patient , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you 've got that the weight self even be a bad story about its experience .
what is a story ?
and that 's true for the stories that define us and it 's true for the stories that we do .
which is a story that 's going to occur , and it 's like , and it 's going to end up
end of us are very , very important , and in that case , the end of the end of the end of the
now , life is alive alive .
it has fun of you , one after another .
and they say , what 's going to happen to those moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're always forever .
i mean most of our life on our life -- and i 've been doing this -- you know , the global side -- as about three seconds , meaning that , you know , there are about 600 million of this -- you know , in a month there are about
most of them are completely ignored from the inside itself .
and yet , you get the sense that you should count that what is happening during those moments of the web is our life .
it 's the organic resource , which we use as we are in this world .
and as we call it , it would seem to be important , but that 's not the story that the privilege itself for us .
so , we 've got the ministry of ourselves and the system itself , and they 're quite different .
the biggest difference between you is that we 're dealing with time .
from the point of the system itself , if you 've got a lecture , and the second week is exactly as good as the first , then , that 's what 's going to be as good as a student college .
this does n't work for the system itself .
so , for the day itself , it 's actually much better than when i 'm going to college , because there are no new memories .
you have n't changed the story .
and in this sense , time is the most important thing , which is a tragic self . it has very little impact on this story .
now , the cheapest self is to tell us what to tell and stories .
it 's actually the physical decisions , because if you have a patient , who 's going to tell two two different surgeons and decide what he wants to vote , and then , the owner of the surgeon who 's
the usda itself has no voice in that choice .
in fact , we do n't choose between ourselves . we choose to experience among memories .
and even if we think about the future , we do n't think about our future , we do n't think about our future .
we think about our future , as we think about our future .
and actually , you can look at this , you know , as a sort of a cathedral of the deceased itself , and you can think of yourself as a one that 's sort of like , that 's sort of like , that 's sort of the play itself through experiences that does n't really need
i 've got the sense that if we 're going to study a lot of times , that is , we 're going to give us a daily role in the finance system itself .
and that 's a little bit hard , i think .
i mean , how do we do about our memories ?
this is one of the main reasons that are being given for the conservation of the millennium itself .
and if i think about it , i think about a tour that we had a couple of years ago , which is clear of the best steps that i 've ever had , and i do n't think quite a lot of
and i have probably influenced by my memory of my memory on this journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes for the last four years .
now , if i 've ever taken the open up with the previous several pictures i 've spent one more hour .
well , this is three weeks , and that 's one another hours .
there seems to be a gentleman .
well , i may be a little bit , you know , in this way , how do you have to do on the health of memories , but even if you do more , there is a real question . why do we give memories to the weight that we
so i want you to think about a thought .
imagine your next blog , you know , at the end of the day , they 're all their images , and they 're going to get an education that they do n't remember .
now , would you ask the same letter ?
and if you wanted to visit a different stranger , there is a conflict between the two types of self , and you have to think about how they 're going to do this conflict , and it 's really not obvious , because if you think about memories , you might
now , why we 're going to pick up what we 're asking is a problem which gives us a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two species of the self , like two questions are happiness .
there are , in fact , two concepts of happiness that we can think about one .
so , you can ask yourself , how happy is the privilege itself ?
and then you would ask , how happy is the most likely in your life ?
and you 're all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we 're going to have a pretty good idea to get away from happiness 's happiness .
if you think about the happiness of happiness , it 's a very different thing .
this is not how happy a person is .
it 's a matter of what 's wrong or the person is when they think about their life .
it 's very different .
everybody who does n't tell these stories is based on the study of happiness , and i 'm going to be an part of a number of researchers about sustainability that have changed the discovery of this magnificent long .
the distinction between the happiness 's happiness and happiness has been recognized in the last few years , and now you 're trying to measure those two .
it 's called a global survey in which more than a million people you 've been asked for what you think about your life and about your experiences , and there 's other interest in the direction .
so in the last few years , we 've begun to learn about the happiness of these two ways of learning .
and the most exciting lesson , which , i think , is that they 're really different .
you can know how someone with his life is , and this is not a lot of how happy he is living and the other way .
just to give you an sense of what we call it is about to run around .
what that means is , if you were somebody else , and you would tell them , oh , his father is a dancer , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you know something about its size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone 's life at a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his own .
so it 's got small .
we know something about what the happiness is doing .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mainly , to be happy with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
now , there are other things , but that 's a real issue .
so if you want to think that the happiness of both species , you will want to make very different things .
the evidence of what i 've said here is that we 're really lucky to think of happiness as an expert of well-being .
it 's a completely different term .
well , just briefly , one of the other reason that we do n't realize about happiness is that we do n't think about the same things that we think about life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to be the right answer .
if you ask that question , you think that people will be happier when they say , let 's live in israel .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the ministry itself , and it 's not very important for the kind of which you 're asking , how happy people are .
but now , because the thing is responsible for itself , they can end up -- some people could end up to california .
and it 's kind of interesting , what happens to happen with people coming to california .
now , you 're not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you 'll think they 're happier , because if you think about it , you 're going to think about how terrible the weather was in the u.k. , and you 're going to feel that they
it 's very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i 've given you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you very much .
now , when we started a couple of weeks ago , they were kind of like they 'd find me that there was a rather interesting outcome that came out of this session .
is this something that can you make us , because you have a few minutes ?
daniel mitchell : sure .
i think the most interesting outcome that we found in the '50s survey is a number that we absolutely absolutely not thought of .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the nervous itself .
if we looked at how feelings the income .
and it turns out that with a $ $ 100,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of american americans , and it 's like , but it 's a large sample of a million times ,
south asia .
sb : shanghai .
fifty dollars a year when people are unhappy , and they 're getting increasingly , and they 're going to be cut .
we get an absolutely open line .
i mean , i 've seen so bright lines .
what happens is , obviously , that money does n't have a monopoly , but that lack of lack of money , and we can do this very , very clearly .
in the spirit of the other self , of course , you get another story .
the more money you are , the more you are .
that is not for emotion .
but thirdly , in the whole american world , it 's about life , freedom .
if people take this seriously seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on your head , everything that we believe , for example , in terms of systems and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country 's going to really take a question of how hard would take , and that 's what causes politics ?
pr : you know , i think there 's an opportunity for the role of the ministry in politics .
it 's going to be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the united states , you 've ever done it , and in other countries , it 's happening .
people are going to be thinking that they think about happiness when they think of politics .
it 's going to be a long time , and people will go to know if you want to look at it , or if you want to look at it , so we have to do that discussion very soon .
now , as you can get happiness , it can be very different about how you think , and whether you think about it , or whether you think about the system itself .
that 's politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you 're going to have to measure what 's called them .
that will , i think , in the next or two decades of the national age .
well , it seems to me , or should , at least the most interesting political conversation going to be about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of economics .
thank you , scott .
i 'm french . i 'm doing video games .
now , i 've been making about 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy as easy to move the world in reality , to save how to save them .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince you to more people , including all of you , to play more time playing the game and play games games .
currently we spend three billion hours a week every week .
some of you might think , `` that 's a lot of time for games . ''
maybe there 's something too much time when you understand how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most significant problems in the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we want to increase that time .
i 've been making a lot that it 's about 21 billion hours per week .
now , that may seem to be a little bit , so i 'm going to work with it : if we do problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global climate , global and economics , i think we need to play games online for
no , i really mean .
why ? this image actually looks like exactly why i believe that games are so critical for survival of the human species in the future , right ?
this is a picture of henry 's dance .
he wanted to feel the feelings of the game , so he 's got a camera built in front of the shoes .
this is one of the classic language games .
if you 're not a player , you might imagine some of the time in this picture .
you probably see that sense of knowledge , of course , of fear , but also to look at attention , trying to solve a really hard problem .
when you play , you can see some of them here , right up to the top of the mouth , and the mouth is a sign of observation . the phone show surprise .
this is a player , which is a player on the edge of what 's called `` the so-called of the universe . ''
oh , you know . ok . so here 's some players .
a portrait portrait , is a result that is so good , that she did n't know it was possible .
it was just beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , you know , they actually become a bit like this . this is a universal portrait .
this player is short before an extremely victory .
and this is what we find in the millions of all around the world around the world , when we 're going to have the first generation of the next century , the face of those who are at the end of the edge of the edge of the edge of a
well , unfortunately , we 're going to look at this face in real life if we are difficult problems .
i call it `` in my life . '' and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that 's me , like i do that in life , i do n't have bad .
this is a school game in my former home in berkeley , california , where i used to work in my 20s -- is better than in real life .
that 's a problem that has many players .
we think we do n't as well as in reality .
and i do n't mean less successful , although that 's what it is .
we 're getting more in training . i mean , i 'm good at the deal with the motivation to do something to work with .
if we 're in a shower , i believe that many of us will come to our best version , and then we immediately know the problem of solving the problem , as long as we do , it will try to make a better step .
and in reality , if we fail , we feel different differently .
we feel deeply . we feel ourselves . we feel like ourselves , perhaps depressed , frustrated , something .
we never have these feelings , if we play games in games , they 're just not .
and that 's what i think of as a research .
why is it impossible to think , you could n't do anything ?
how can we feel that emotions of play ?
so i started playing games like the world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment for the financial system .
and i 've got some things i 've figured , that 's going to make a break , you know .
well , first of all , if you 're in one of this charter , particularly in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters that are willing to give you a mission mission , and that 's immediately .
but not just a mission , but it 's a mission that the perfect level of the current level of play is right , right ?
so , they do that .
they never get a task that they ca n't solve .
but always on the edge of your ability , so you have to do it , but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you 're not around around and you 're going around . you 've always got something important to do something .
and there are indigenous employees .
where you 're going to go , hundreds of people who are working with you to make your work mission .
we do n't have the real life in real life , that feeling that when you give up , you have paid for people .
also , there 's this historical story , this sort of wonder of history , why we are there and what we do .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
you 've heard about `` scale up high , '' which is `` pure strength '' or `` personal intelligence . ''
now , that kind of thing feedback out of real life .
if i go open this stage , i do n't have to speak , speak , a crazy crazy idea , crazy crazy idea .
i do n't get in real life in real life .
so , the problem of `` the '' as well , of course , is that it 's such as a result of time , given the edge of a robotic state system , that we 're going to spend all of our time in those two days .
they 're just better than reality .
until today , all the world of warcraft have spent a lot of years to spend the virtual problems of parenting .
it 's not necessarily bad .
it may sounds bad .
but in the context , in the context , we started looking at our first to go to our first .
so the first thing that you 've got .
ok , so , if we talk about it , how much time we spend currently currently playing with games , does that only sense when you look at the time at the scale of human development , which is extremely .
but again , because it turns out that we can use this as a whole time of doing this as a human time .
we 're moving to become a whole , of being a little creatures .
that 's the truth . that 's what i believe .
look at the interesting statistics , which was published by a researcher of london 's recent university : the average young man from living in a country with tremendous design , with 14 hours to the 21st of a century .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , they 're going to have the same thing that they 're doing in school , from the five grade to the end of school -- if you never do n't .
so , we 've got a complete network that 's young people for young people , what it means to be a good player , like anything else , what you learn about school .
and maybe some of you write the new book of `` bossy , '' `` it . ''
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success .
it 's based on the great research of what 's happening , if we 're going to spend 10,000 hours with the nuclear age of a single event on the 21st for the 21st of the year , 10 times , we 're going to
we 're going to do so good at whatever whatever the most important people in the world .
so , what we 've got here is a whole generation of young people who are unemployed .
so the big question is , `` well , what 's the players do ? ''
because if we could find that , we would have never before having a given human potential .
so many people in the world we have spent the world at least an hour per day .
this is our waste . 500 million people , who are extraordinary in `` something . ''
and in the next decade , we have another billion players , who 's pretty extraordinary things .
if you do n't have heard of it before .
the game industry is designed to save the energy , and to work instead , instead of doing it , in order to the world , especially in india , china , in brazil .
you expect to be a million billion player in the next decade .
so that 's what we 've got about a lot of billions of times .
so i started to think about what it is like to do these games .
here 's the four things i found . i thought , first one .
ok , so let 's look at this as stupid .
now , the desire to do is immediately , immediately , to do it , and we believe that we have a visual hope of success .
and players , always believe that a universal entropy is possible , and that 's always worth trying to do it , and it 's a bit .
players sit around .
so , players are masters in the form of cheap social nets .
there 's a lot of interesting research that show us what we like to do , when we played with them , even if they were ashamed of grass .
the reason is that there 's a lot of trust to play a game .
we trust that a time , with us , is that the rules of the rules , that we have the same thing , and that 's the end of it .
so , the way of that is the environment of cooperation , trust and others .
and as a result of this , we build more social relationships .
productivity productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's one reason why you 're going to make a week of 24 hours a week , you know , sort of old .
the reason is , when we 're playing , we 're actually happy to work hard than we do n't care or nothing .
we know that we can act as human beings , when we 're hard , great work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right thing .
and finally , radical meaning .
players , it 's like to be used to be a bit of violent 's affordable ,
so here 's a bow to put that to the right light , you know all of wikipedia , the greatest contribution in the world .
the second thing in the world , at the world of the world , is the world of warcraft .
five million people are using it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft in the internet as we talked about some other stuff in every other of the world .
they create an interactive story .
they create an incredibly source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four groups that are going to make a single outcome , and players are trained , you find individuals .
it 's people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that 's the problem that i 'm going to try to do .
daniel williams is a remix .
his work is a great thing . he shows why people spend so much time , energy and money on it .
and he says , `` we 're going to move away from no less than an egg in virtual worlds . ''
and that 's an amazing thing . so it makes sense .
and he says ...
do n't like me , i 'm a little bit .
so he says that that makes sense , because players can achieve more than the real life than in real life .
they can play much more effective social than they live in real life . they think more and more creative and more games than in real life .
so , he says , well , it 's true that the players can spend more time in the virtual world than in the real way .
i just want to find that way .
but it 's not definitely not .
we 've got to start changing the real world .
my inspiration comes from an event that goes back to me .
there 's this kind of wild chocolate , you know . you know what ?
well , in this wonderful talk , it 's been taken .
and these were the first first of people that were built out .
and if you 're dealing with the familiar of the old physicist , you know , you may know this story . the story about how it was invented .
and out loud , games , games , in the u.k. , was introduced during a famine .
in fact , there was such a great famine , that the king 's king has come up with a crazy idea .
people were worried about people . people .
it was an extreme situation . you had to have a big solution .
so they set up , according to the camp and they had a national strategy . on a day if you eat food , and the next day you would play .
and they would be so much about this , because games are so fascinating , and they 're filled with labor , independent productivity , they forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then on the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and it would take her 18 years as 18 years as 18 as 18 years as a day .
so , i think we 're playing a games today .
we 're going to play games to make the suffering from the real world .
we 're going to play games to make sure that does n't work in the real world , especially in real life 's real life , and we 're going to give us what we need to play .
but that does n't have to be the end .
that 's the project .
it was n't going to come back to 18 years ago , and so i said , the king , was one last day .
they put it in two of them .
and she played a job and the secret access to a professional musician .
and she went up and she did go for the search for a new home , and they had a new home . they had a lot of people back to how food food was food , and the rest of the rest of one area in which they were able to survive .
sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , what 's remarkable is , is that the mosquito that later later , the same dna , the same dna as the old age .
and so scientists came out recently , that 's a crazy story .
and biologists found the evidence of a global ethic for almost 20 years , which is what could explain .
so , there might be the crazy story .
maybe they actually had their ability through games for 18 years by now for 18 years , and then they had these records , and so much about it , they learned that they had this entire civilization .
so , we can do that .
we 've been doing in eastern europe .
this was the first time in real time in the world , which was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years for 18 years , and we 're playing for 16 years .
i mean , we 're ready for our own collective play .
so , they stopped half their civilization on the search for a new world , and so i 'm going to take my 21 billion here a week .
we should be at the end that half an hour of us spend an hour with games until we have the problems of the real world .
i know you 're going to ask you , `` how do we solve problems of the real world ? '' and that 's exactly what i 've done my work in the last year for the future .
we 've got this graffiti in our office in palo garage , as we look at the future .
we do n't want to say the future .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best result , and then people are going to go up to take this idea into reality .
we 're going to imagine ourselves , and we give people to achieve the opportunity to achieve .
i 'm going to show you about three games that i designed to try to try and try and find people in their own future .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a game where you have to have a conversation over .
it 's been invented , but we 've got enough of them so it 's for them , and it 's their real life in the real life , so if they turn into the game , they say , `` how much oil is going to tell you where they live , and then you get
we 've done this game in 2007 , and we 've been doing it over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a landscape experience .
nobody wants to change their life because it 's good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you 're in a liberal adventure and you 're going to say , `` this is oil . ''
this is an amazing adventure .
find out how they were going to survive , and most of our players have made it in the game .
so we set up for the next game game , which is a bigger and a bigger target than just a little bit .
we 've done the game `` dance '' at the institute of the future .
now , the head of a sudden that the people will only have 23 years on the planet .
this consumer is called `` global economy , '' of course .
the call to a player , is to say , we 've almost like a `` dance '' designed to design .
you know , you know , scott , you know , where they 've got the `` go '' and they have the center , the scientists , the creator , and they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , say , everybody is in the open , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
more thousand players playing a game for eight weeks .
they found these drones incredibly complex solutions that they can read when they 're `` tooth . ''
and the last thing we can do is on three feet . look ahead . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
when you play the game , you 've got to think about the world bank , which is called social pricing , 2010 .
we 're working with universities in sub-saharan africa , and we open them to learn how to learn .
we 've got a bow on it . we have `` heart high '' for you , and you get sustainability , sustainability , sustainability , vision and success .
i 'd like to encourage you all to this game with young people , all around the world , especially in the world , particularly , in terms of what it 's about , that 's the social social system to save the world .
i 'll come to the end .
i want to ask you something questions .
what , do you think , what happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we 've got games that show us what we can do , but we do n't have the real world .
well , i hope i hope that the players are human resources to work in real life , and that games will have a big meaning of change .
we have this whole tendency , productivity productivity , which ability to grow up to a lot of social networking , and that 's desire for that desire .
i hope i really hope that we can play a lot of play around this planet .
and i hope you 'll play with me and play these games .
when i 'm going to do the next decade , i 'm going to be doing two things : that we can make any lasting future , and that we can play the play play .
so , i say , let me run the games games .
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you a little bit about what i was looking at a few months ago , and i 've been writing a writer for a magazine for a physicist project .
so i used to write the writing that i 've always been my own , but i was done with the course of it , and i realized that i 've never never lived in my life , which is the word ``
i 'm going to read you the guy .
`` oops '' : `` yo , mama , snakes , birds , school , school , flop , ack , gobble , gobble , gobble , gobble , toilet , toilet , toilet , toilet , clean , clean , you also hurt and weak .
js : healthy , strong , negative . ''
i 've read that list of a friend , and i had to find it , it seemed to be so ridiculous , but i was only going to speak to `` no , '' and was n't going to stop reading , and i could n't go to stop reading , and
now , of course , this was a dance , old baby , and i just thought it was going to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a little bit of early in the early '80s , when i was working with my student , and it began to form my way outside of my family , and to shape , also in terms of other children and around the world around me .
and thank god , i did n't use a use job .
i would take this crazy seriously , i would be a world in a world that someone like me as a person , whose life can be able to do now , but today , i 'm going to have been interested in the opportunity and
so , i was immediately going to go to the ministry of 2009 , and i thought that i 'm going to find a good here .
here 's the digital version of this device .
it 's not much better .
in particular , the last two words are `` at a time , '' `` all right . ''
but it 's not just the words of words .
it 's about what we think about people that we think about these words .
it 's about the values that are in these words , and how we create these values .
our language affect our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many of them societies societies , including the leaders , and the british , they really believed that they have a big force in a big force , because that 's what they 're looking at loud , they can fall .
so , what do we do in the end -- a people who 's a smart person ?
just as a person , for example , as a kid , it might be a little bit , they get it and they 're very serious .
would n't it be nice to open up ?
one person who got home for me was at a date , was in my hometown . at the institute of pittsburgh in tanzania .
he 's called dr. shark . a new name , you can imagine , how you can imagine most americans are n't going to be wrong . so , he 's called the name of the name .
and dr. watson was always going to be used to fly like this work with children with children like created .
i was looking at the time i 've spent a hospital in this hospital , just a great thing -- except for my home .
i did n't have to just look at each other times with this bowl of sculpture -- in various colors -- that 's what you 've been doing in order to build my job , and i 'm taking it back to you than anything else . i
and imagine , i actually worked as a child kid with dr. watson , and that 's trying to stop these games , not without success .
and one day , he had to look at one of my life -- these things were just screaming and pepper -- and he said to me , `` wow , yeah , you 're such a strong , galvao , and young girls you 're going to have one of these
and if you can do it , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
and it was just a bit of a simple game of dr. footage , so i did make these things that i do n't want to make my look at new eyes , and so that became a new and very early experience .
and i 'm asking today , how much his vision of me as a strong and young young woman who had to feel more of the same way , and i could think of myself as a natural nature of a strong , powerful and old person .
that 's just an example of many , like adults , in a way , who can feel like adults .
but just like , you know , take examples out of the evidence , our language does n't imagine something that we would all want to , which is to find any individual , to think of themselves as a powerful person .
our language made the social changes , which has been developed by an technological change .
from the medical point of view , you can say , `` my legs , '' the `` tooth , '' comes out of steel and artificial furniture , and it 's designed a new identity for a living body that allowed people to do themselves .
so , perhaps the technological changes of this technology , is because there 's always been another truth , which is that every human being able to be able to do something very small and very , and that human ability , our
human ability to imagine -- that 's an interesting story , because people always ask me to ask me to do so , how do i deal with , and i 'm going to tell you a little bit : this sentence has never been
this sentence is going to be linked by the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge , without being able to experience it , like , if my life would have been so successful , because i could make the same way of a life with a
but the truth is , of course , we 're going to change , of course , we are from the challenge , whether they 're physical , or even the truth is that we 're going to change . so , of course ,
and i 'm saying it 's good .
there are no exceptions that we need to have to come to our lives better .
there is no way to our lives .
and i tend to see more than seeing my shadow .
sometimes i feel like he 's very strange , sometimes he 's not to see it , but it 's always constantly .
and i do n't want to focus on that either the effect of the impact , the ability of a man in a man .
there are , in life , there are the challenges , and challenges , and they are just incredibly real , and each person 's going to be different , but the question is not whether we 're going to come out and do
so we 're not just responsible for the people that we love , but they also make it right now to get good .
and we do n't teach our kids , if we can give them the feeling they ca n't afford .
you 've got to get two things : one of the medical times , you have to be in the same way that i 'm not as a writer or not .
and to be honest , the only is true and valuable , which i have to add to it through , is that the world is constantly , so you can see me in this particular relationship .
in our desire to protect us , to protect us , we need to protect us in heart , and the truth , the hard truth about their medical planning , or even in a sense of what they 're expected , we need to think about
maybe it 's the process that is only what 's happening in a cancer , and how we 're going to do that , for every single individual , much greater than that ,
if we treat a human human beings , and not all its forces and opportunities , and we create in addition to the natural struggle that they may have , another disease .
we become a human being that for our society .
so we have to look beyond what we 've got to look at , and we focus on each other on the human possibilities .
but most importantly , is that it is between the perception of our imagination and our greatest , of course .
so , we should not call them through those two times , or if we should n't be trying to avoid them , to avoid them , we should be put them under the ground , but it 's about finding opportunities .
but i think it 's probably a little bit more about the fact that we do n't have to worry about ourselves , but that 's what we 're open to , to become that , to make it in the process of the way to actually be able to use an egg
and maybe we make it as to be more natural , to see , to see , to see , to see and feel like their presence in terms of no way .
in this year , we were listening to 200 people , and when he had 150 years ago about evolution , has darwin , in my eyes , in my eyes , in a slightly true real life on human character .
i 'd like it to be that : not the most powerful of his life , but also not the luxury of his species , but who can adapt to change changes .
we have made creativity come from a conflict .
it 's not just that if we know that the capacity of people , too much , from the struggle of the human mind , is to spread through conflict .
so , again , change and effort are the best difficult of humans .
and maybe we even know what we 're doing when we 're really going to be .
maybe that 's exactly the sense of authenticity , a sense of our own power .
we can just imagine ourselves .
we can give us a new meaning that goes beyond very long times .
maybe we can think of as change as important .
we 're going to be able to stand for a change that we have n't made yet .
i think the biggest majority we have given ourselves to ourselves is we 're going to be normal .
in fact , who 's normal ?
there is no normal .
you have the same thing . the typical thing . but not the normal thing , and you would use that poor , you know , you really want to want to learn if they were really ?
i think that 's not .
well , it would be great if we found this paradigm against another one of the possibility or the strength , to actually make it a little bit of a dangerous , could be able to do it , so we can control the forces of very many children , and they
what we found out is that we 've given people to have our society of our society : useful , to be able to do something .
and there 's evidence that has been called the census of a hundred years ago , older people , and people have been diagnosed with severe mental illness , and that 's what happened because the life of interest in these individuals
they do n't have these people as bad , and they 're terrified , they have become something special .
a couple of years ago , i was in the town where i grew up in the city , in the middle of the green spot , and i was standing in front of a magazine .
it was in summer , and i was hooked .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , `` well , if that 's not worth illegal . ''
and i was looking around , and i see this young man , and i had no idea who he is .
and i 'm like , `` sorry , sir , you know ? i ca n't remember you . ''
and he said , `` well , you do n't really remember me .
when i first saw her first time , i was taking it out of my mother . ''
oh , well .
and so , of course , it 's taken up .
this was dr. williams , a man that i just learned about my mother about this day , because i , of course , i do n't know , at my last birthday , at my birthday i got two weeks .
the doctor 's physician 's physician 's a mother school at night , and it was like my parents ' man who brought me to the world .
and because i was n't born and my feet after them , and i just had a couple of hair on this one , and a couple of play on the other foot he had , he was able to get the master
and he said to me , `` i had to say to your parents that you would never go home , and would never be as your body of life as other kids , or you could never live a life 's life , and since
and what i found was that , he had a lot of all of my whole childhood , no matter if i was going to go at a concert in the second grade , whether i was working with the helmet at the ground at a time , whether i
and he was called this part of his [ the ] ] the potential of human .
you ca n't simply be able to predict how significant this could be used to the quality of life .
and dr. watson , he said , `` i 've learned that kids , if they do n't always get another thing , and even if they just get some support , if you feed kids , they can do a lot of it .
you see , dr. watson has changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone would use , two different things .
and i 've always changed my thinking over the time if you had ever changed me in the age of 15 years , whether i could n't buy my fingers against two and bones , then i would n't have a second .
i was just trying to go back in that way .
if you ask me , i 'm not sure .
and that 's happened because i 've done something like my phone and i do n't have any of those experiences .
and maybe it could also happen in the change because i 've been so many people who 've made me open , instead of people that i wanted or give up a notion .
you see , it really does really take a person to show you how they can control their forces , and they 're through .
if you can allow someone to do their own , more forces -- the human spirit -- if you do that , and for someone in a particular moment , you open your door , and then you 're for these people a very good teacher .
they 're going to open up their own .
the real meaning of the word `` `` '' '' `` `` '' '' in `` of course . ''
it means something that is in one of the potential to have potential .
again , what do we want to do now ?
in the '60s of the '60s , it was in britain in britain a year , and then grew up into copenhagen .
they call it that 's called `` bossy , '' in the u.s. , we call it as `` sh . ''
students are going to come back to the notes .
and the people who are getting incredibly difficult business , the better teachers are so far .
and then you have over a quick couple of times students with a `` good '' and after these three months , that was `` very good . '' it 's been told them , they 're very smart , and after these three months , they 've really written
and of course , it 's going to hear a heart that 's the other game that 's being told , that 's just enough .
and it was the same after the three months .
but just those who still were in school , the number of students who were in school .
and what was really critical about this study was that the teachers were n't going out .
the teachers did n't know that something was being changed .
they were just told that the students were , and the students end up with the stage , and they were taught to them , and they were treated .
the only thing is , the only thing is a strange mind , that 's broken , that has no hope . he finds nothing more beautiful . he 's missing our natural natural , and our
but if we do it , the human spirit to support the human mind , to hope , to hope , and other people , to find , to be curious , to make sure , to be able to make it really positive .
so when a spirit about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new .
i want to end with a poem that 's written by a poet named in the 19th century , and i 'd like to call my friend friend , but the god says `` every kid , '' `` every kid knows god , not the god
come , dance with me . thank you very much .
