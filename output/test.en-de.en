as steve lopez , the los angeles times , one day , by the streets in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , UNK , rough , homeless , who was in a violin , who was only two strings .
many of you are going to know the story , because from UNK articles , it was later on a book , which was UNK , with robert UNK , with robert UNK , and jamie UNK , UNK UNK , the UNK , who was at the UNK of the UNK , the UNK
UNK left UNK , ran a UNK and 30 years later , he was living as a UNK at the streets of UNK in the center of los angeles .
i recommend you all of you to read , reading the book or to look at the movie , so you do n't just understand the wonderful connectedness that is between these two men , but also how the music had made that connection , and how to get the instrument , if this UNK is UNK , the UNK , UNK
i met mr UNK UNK in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney UNK hall .
he just had a demo of UNK first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine .
he talked in a very UNK and UNK sound of yo-yo ma and hillary UNK , and about how the dodgers could never make it in the baseball world , and all of the UNK UNK in the last sentence in the last set of UNK UNK in the last
we came up to the theme of music , and a few days later , i got an email , which was , in fact , UNK was interested in me .
i still have to mention that UNK UNK a medical treatment , because he had been treated UNK and treated UNK and UNK , a trauma that has been following his entire life .
and as a consequence , it 's very vulnerable to these schizophrenic periods . they 're so bad , and they go for days , and they go back to the streets of UNK UNK UNK , always in the UNK of his own mind .
and in exactly a UNK UNK was UNK , when we started with our first job in the walt disney hall in the walt disney hall , he had this dialogue box in his eyes and worked completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke , and how to UNK somebody in my sleep .
i was afraid , not UNK , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his modes , and that i could be able to go back to him , and i could be able to destroy his relationship with the violin , when i started to talk about UNK and UNK and other exciting forms of UNK UNK .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of UNK UNK .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in UNK eyes , there was a crowded change in UNK .
it was like if he stood under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical reaction , which was my catalyst .
UNK UNK UNK turned into understanding , into a calm curiosity and UNK .
and how through a miracle he took his violin and started to play some of some excerpts from UNK , and then asked me to play it , UNK , UNK , UNK .
and we started to talk about music , from UNK beethoven , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , from UNK to UNK UNK .
and i realized he was n't just a UNK knowledge of music , but with her also a strong personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding of my colleagues just from my colleague in los angeles .
by writing music and talked about music , from this UNK UNK , UNK man , who was still in the streets of los angeles , a UNK , UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK musicians , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK .
music is medicine . music is changing .
for UNK , music means UNK health .
because the music allows him to UNK his thoughts and delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity .
and so he UNK his UNK .
i realized that exactly what is the nature of the art .
this is the reason we do music : so that we do something that 's inside all of us , deep inside of all , our feelings , through our artistic lens through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of that expression is reached all of us and moving , inspired and unites .
what UNK UNK , so the music took back to a community of friends .
the UNK force of music took him back into a family of musicians that understood his way to realized his talent and UNK it .
and i 'm going to play with UNK music , whether in the walt disney UNK , or in UNK UNK , because he reminds me why i 've gotten a musician .
thank you very much .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i 'd like to play a little bit that i 've stolen the UNK of the UNK .
i hope you 're pardon me .
so i 've known a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two .
the first one was more like an passionate UNK .
it was a beautiful fish , UNK , good UNK , UNK , UNK on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was selectively in UNK after the supposedly of highest standards of sustainability .
so you could probably feel about selling it .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
and one day the boss called the company , and i asked , if i was able to tell a event about the sustainability of the farm .
`` of course , '' i said .
so here was a company trying to solve what has gotten this incredible problem for our chefs . how are we going to keep fish on our UNK ?
in the last 50 years , we 've got the oceans , and we have UNK the oceans .
it 's hard to do the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , they have collapsed .
it 's almost nothing left .
so probably , or bad UNK , UNK , a part of our future .
a lot of the arguments about it . UNK pollute the environment , most of them , and they 're inefficient , take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a UNK from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of UNK is necessary to get a pounds of UNK .
not very sustainable .
it 's not too good .
so here 's finally a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to teach them .
the day before , i called the boss of the UNK for the company .
let 's call it him .
`` well , '' i said , `` just to have the facts right , you are famous for that , to grow up that way out in the ocean , that you do n't have the environment . ''
`` this is true , '' he said , `` we are so far outside the waste of our fish , not focused . ''
and then he added , `` we 're basically a own world .
this UNK from UNK to one , he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
UNK to one , great .
`` UNK to what ? what is your ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said . put on .
and on that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , `` what to hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the time of the event , UNK .
and i said , `` well , what are sustainable proteins are ? ''
he said he did n't know that . he 's going to go up .
well , i UNK with a few people in the company . no one could give me a real answer , until i finally end with the senior biologists .
let 's call it as well .
`` UNK , '' i said , `` what are sustainable proteins ? ''
well , he mentioned some algae and some UNK , and then he said , `` UNK . ''
i said , `` UNK ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers , skin , UNK , insulate , UNK and eat . ''
i said , `` how much percent of your UNK is chicken ? ''
in the assumption maybe , maybe two percent .
`` well , this is about 30 percent , '' he said .
and i said , `` well , what is sustainable to feed the chicken into fish ? ''
there was a long break in the line , and he said , `` there 's just too much chicken in the world . ''
i UNK myself from this fish .
no , not because i 'm a UNK UNK and UNK .
that 's me even .
no , i 've actually UNK UNK from this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish after that conversation after the chicken .
this second one is a different kind of UNK .
it 's the romantic kind of , the way you get , the better you know your fish , you 'll know the fish more .
i was eating him in a restaurant in UNK .
a UNK journalist had been talking about this a long time ago .
it 's got a little bit of UNK .
he came up on the table with a UNK , almost UNK white color .
the chef had UNK him .
keep twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can let a fish do so good after he was UNK ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
let 's call it miguel . actually , it 's miguel .
and no , he does n't deserve the fish , and he 's not a chef . at least in the way that you and i understand .
he 's a biologist at UNK la UNK .
this is a UNK UNK in the UNK corner .
it 's near the UNK of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of UNK .
they have UNK UNK on what was basically the wetlands .
they made it by UNK the country .
they built this complicated consequence of channels , and they put water out of the land and out into the river .
well , they could n't make that it was working , not economically .
and bone is a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds in the birds , which are a lot of birds .
and in 1982 , an spanish company bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the river of the water backwards .
they literally UNK the dials .
instead of UNK the water , they used the channels to UNK the water back .
they UNK the channels .
they created an 11,000 acres of UNK -- UNK , UNK , shrimp , eel -- and with that , miguel and his company has the ecological destruction completely around .
the farm is incredible .
i mean you 've never seen anything like this .
they 're looking at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you 're looking at are UNK channels and these density , windows march .
i was n't there at the time of miguel .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and part of the UNK to the kiss .
okay ? so we were and fought in the wetlands and i struggled with the wetlands and i UNK and UNK and UNK , and miguel UNK is UNK .
and here he takes a rare UNK .
now , he mentioned the UNK of phytoplankton .
and here , there 's a pattern of UNK that reminds him in the UNK giraffe .
it turns out miguel has spent the largest part of his career in the UNK national park in africa .
i asked him how to become so UNK .
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know anything about fish .
i 'm an expert on relationships . ''
and then it goes into more UNK of rare birds and algae and strange UNK .
and do n't get me wrong , which was really interesting , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
it 's great , but i was love with love .
and my head was weak by this UNK piece of UNK fish that i had on the UNK .
so i stopped him . i said , miguel , how does your fish get that good ? ''
he showed up on the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that 's incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the UNK ? ''
well , he continued to tell me that it 's such a clear system that the fish eat , which they would eat in the wild .
the UNK biomass , the phytoplankton , that 's what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely UNK .
there 's no food .
the one farm that does n't feed the animals ?
and later on the day , i was working on this property of miguel , and i asked him , and i said , `` well , for a place that seems to be so natural , '' different than any farm i 've ever been , `` how are you succeeding ? ''
in the moment , it was like an UNK demands a UNK .
and we wipe the corner , and we provided the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands of babies , a literally UNK UNK that 's actually UNK .
`` this is success , '' he said .
`` look at your UNK , pink .
they UNK . ''
UNK ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` miguel , do n't you do your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and UNK to the birds .
now , last year , there was 600,000 birds in this philosophy , more than 250 different species .
it 's the largest one today , and one of the most important private countries in europe has gotten into europe .
and i said , `` miguel , is a good UNK UNK , not the last thing you want to have on a UNK ? ''
he blew his head , no .
he said , `` we 're building UNK , not much .
this is a major network of network here .
the nanoscale are eating the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the retina , the belly is the better the system . ''
okay , let 's rethink that . a farm that does n't feed your animals and a farm that happens to your success at your health health .
a UNK , but also a UNK .
oh , and by the way , this baker is not even going to be there .
they 're mapping in a city of 12,000 miles away from where the UNK is better for the UNK .
every morning , they fly 12,000 miles to farm .
and they 're going to fly around 12,000 miles .
they do that because they can follow the UNK white line of the highway .
seriously .
i had introduced a kind of UNK of the penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , `` miguel , are you going to fly miles away from the farm to the farm , and go back to the evening ?
do you do that for the children ? ''
and he looked at me when i had just been quoted a song by the alphabet in the moment .
he said , `` no . you do that , because the food is better . ''
i do n't mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i do n't like a UNK . i do n't like it . i do n't like you .
it 's this UNK , UNK taste .
i 'll almost never sleep with that .
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in UNK , they did n't have any UNK .
she liked sweet and pure as if you 'd take a bites from the ocean .
i mentioned that miguel and he UNK .
he said , `` the skin works like a sponge .
it 's the last one that 's going to go back to the body .
it evolved throughout the course of evolution to UNK UNK . ''
and then he said , `` but our water does n't have any UNK . ''
okay . a farm that does n't feeds your fish . a farm that happens at your success at the success of your predators .
and then , i realized , if he says , a farm that does n't have a UNK , he UNK it , because the water that flows through this farm from the river in UNK .
it 's a river , which leads all the things that they do today , they tend to lead , chemical pollutants , UNK of UNK .
and if it was fought by the system , and this leaves , it 's cleaner , as it is UNK .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not just a farm that does n't lie , not only one farm that is UNK her success at the health of the health of her predators , but a farm which is literally a UNK , and not only for these fish , but also for you and me .
because when the water UNK , it UNK in the atlantic .
a drop of the ocean , i know , but i 'll take it , and you should do it , because these UNK , like UNK , is also telling you .
you could say it 's a recipe for the future of good food , whether we 're talking about UNK or UNK .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one where food actually tastes good .
but for many people , it 's a little bit of radical .
we 're not UNK , we 're UNK . we 're lover .
we love UNK . we love small UNK . we 're talking about regional food . we 're eating food .
and if you say that 's the things that give you the future of good food , you say , `` hey , people , i love pink flamingos , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like that question .
no , not because we 've been producing enough calories to feed the world more than only .
one billion people are going to exist today .
one billion -- that 's more than before -- because UNK inequalities the distribution , not the UNK .
well , i do n't like this question because you have the logic of our UNK over the last 50 years .
UNK grain in UNK , UNK UNK , chemicals on the earth , chicken in fish , and all the time the agribusiness simply said , `` if we feed more people cheaper , how terrible can that be ? ''
this was the UNK . it was the UNK . it was the UNK of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a diet in UNK , a craft , which is UNK , very quickly , UNK .
this is not a craft , and it 's not agriculture .
our UNK is under threat today , not because UNK UNK , but because of UNK resources .
not by the latest UNK and UNK , not by fertile land , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by chainsaws , but in forests , and not by UNK and nets , but through fish in the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that allow every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , do n't look at the UNK of the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines stand at it , and it never has a really good job to eat .
instead of looking at the ecological model .
this is that , on two billion years of UNK UNK .
look miguel , farmers like miguel .
they do n't have businesses that are not worlds for themselves , they have businesses , rather than UNK , businesses , they do n't know , they do n't have a lot of UNK , farmers , who are not only UNK , but experts
because they are the ones who are also UNK .
and if i really am , you 're a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , that 's me right , because if that 's the future good food , it 's going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to share with you today , the totality of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of your bits and instead of thinking about UNK , i want to think you think about how we can think about how we can use information , that we can think of the way we can
so , what we 're looking at here is a typical UNK at age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it 's UNK , and what i can do with UNK is that i can make a certain cause of death , say , UNK .
and immediately , i see another pattern that turns out .
it 's because in the UNK here , the people who are on the UNK , and they 're over here on the UNK .
we can go out one step and sort of UNK the data and see the data and see that UNK and cancer are the normal suspects , but not for everybody .
now , if we 're going to go further and go back to age , we say 40 years or younger , we 'll see , you know , you know , you know , 40 years or younger , we 'll see that crashes have even the most important thing to
and who 's going to see that this is true in men as well .
so what you can see is that the look at information and data is UNK very much in this way in a living in a living space .
and if we can do this for raw materials , why not for any content itself ?
so what we 're now here is the UNK of every single UNK UNK , which has ever been printed .
it 's all here . it 's all online .
you 'd like to test it after my talk in your classroom .
with UNK , you can jump into a decade .
you can zoom in one particular year .
you can jump directly into a certain copy .
now , if i look at this , i see the athletes who appear in this copy and the sports .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so let me go around and go to the rest of me in which lance is going to show me in lance armstrong .
now , if i just want to get a UNK producer , i could think , `` okay , what if i look at the theme of the theme ? ''
so i go back and go back and get the perspective .
now i look greg UNK .
and so you get an idea of that if you put in this kind of type of information , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , you do n't just like , or not just UNK .
you do something that 's actually a little bit different .
it 's something in between , and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
so i 'd like to do this idea a little bit further with something a little bit crazy .
what we 've done here is we took every single UNK and they put them into a small UNK .
the summary contains a short UNK and a symbol for the area that it comes from .
i 'll just show the top 500 of the UNK UNK .
but even in this UNK view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia .
i 'm going to choose the theme .
well , after i chose to do UNK , i 've got to know that the UNK , which are at the most of the time , at the most time , is UNK , time UNK , `` people of the year . ''
this is really important , because this is a realization that is not in one of the individual UNK .
that 's just to recognize if you look at one step and look at it .
UNK on one of these UNK UNK , i then can go into the theme of `` people of the year , '' and they all see together .
now , if i look at all these people , i think the majority of them are UNK . some people come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here 's my boss . and one comes from the UNK .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump now and look at all the ted prize .
you can look at the net the first time the first time , as if it 's really a network , not only to page , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else could be a small surprise .
i 'm just going to show you just the new york times website .
UNK , this application , i do n't want to call it a browser ; it 's really not a browser , but you can look at websites with this -- and we can look at this UNK of every single website like this .
so i can go back one step and go back to a specific UNK UNK .
so this is important because you just look at the look at web websites in this way , all the way in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my process in a certain time period .
here 's the state of the entire demonstration that i 've been giving up here .
and i can kind of look at what i 've been looking at today , again .
and , if i look at a step further and look at everything , i can look at my process of new , maybe after my UNK , and here , i was looking for UNK , here , UNK , or here , UNK , UNK ,
and from here , i can go into the page and do it again .
it 's a metaphor that 's used over again , and every time it 's going to make it bigger than the sum of the UNK .
right now , in this world , we think data is a curse .
we 're talking about the curse of the UNK .
we 're talking about `` surrender in information . ''
what if we could turn that situation around and put the internet on the head , so that we instead of going to go from one to the other , start from many things to a lot of things , and to see patterns that could n't be
if we can do this , it becomes UNK , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving in information , we can get out of it .
and if we know knowledge , we may even have some UNK .
so i 'm listening to that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a UNK portion of science fiction .
in my high school , i was working with the bus to school every day an hour .
and my nose was always in a book , a UNK that my thought in other worlds are UNK , and in UNK , my deep UNK in me , UNK UNK curiosity .
and this curiosity also showed that i was always when i was n't in school , through the forests of the UNK , traveled and the samples of the UNK , frogs and snakes and UNK , everything came home and looked under the microscope .
i was totally UNK , you know .
and it was always about trying to understand the world and the borders of the potential .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my environment , because back in the late '60s , we went to the moon and we explored the deep ocean .
jacques cousteau came up in our living room with his fascinating shows that the animals and places and a world full of miracles that we could never had before .
and that 's what i mean , very good at that UNK UNK .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's no video games like this , with computer-generated films , with computer-generated films , who gave the whole video film in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to do that at the time . when we read a book , we took the description of the UNK , and put them on the screen in our heads .
so my reaction was to draw and draw from aliens , alien worlds , robots , UNK , UNK , all like that .
in UNK , i was constantly caught by the teachers , like me , UNK UNK , UNK .
the creativity had to be sort of out .
and what happened was something interesting . what was fascinated me at jacques UNK UNK was the idea of an entirely unknown world here on the earth itself .
certainly , i would never be an alien world with a spaceship . it seemed very unlikely to me .
but here was a world i could actually enter , here on earth , and she was as fascinating and exotic as all that i had always imagined when i was reading these books .
so i decided when i was 15 , to become scuba diving .
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
but i did n't let it out .
i UNK my father , until he finally had a UNK in UNK , new york , found , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my UNK in a pool of UNK in the winter of UNK , new york .
but the ocean , but the real ocean , i got only two years later to face when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years now , in the 40 years now , i 've spent about UNK UNK of UNK , 500 hours of that in UNK .
and i 've learned that the world of the deep ocean , even in the UNK oceans , so rich in UNK life , is how we really ca n't possibly imagine .
the imagination of nature does n't know limits , unlike our own , UNK human imagination .
to the last days , i feel utter awe of what i see in my UNK .
and my love to the ocean is holding , with the same intensity as anything and ever .
when i was an adult , a job UNK , it was UNK .
this seemed the best way to tell my inner desire , to make stories with my need , to create pictures .
as a child , i was doing UNK and so .
so movies were the way , pictures and stories , and that fit together .
of course , the stories i was UNK , from the UNK , `` terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` UNK . ''
in `` UNK , '' i could have my UNK for the UNK , and they 're linked to the UNK .
so basically my two passions .
something interesting happened at `` UNK '' : to solve a UNK problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid UNK -- we had to build a hot animation , UNK , UNK .
and what came out was the first computer-generated UNK that ever had to see in a movie .
so the film does n't have a money , in fact , he was playing the UNK , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience in the world was like UNK of the magic he was leaving .
according to arthur clarke 's law , we have to know UNK technology and magic to UNK .
so they saw some magic .
and that was what i found incredibly exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , that needs to be involved in UNK . ''
so we went in `` terminator two , '' my next film , a lot more .
together with UNK , we created the guy out of liquid metal , and the success was UNK by the way that this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we had created some magic , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we 've got a little bit more money with the film .
from these two experiences , we created a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for creativity .
so i started a company , together with my good friend UNK winston , who was at the best UNK and UNK . she was called `` digital UNK . ''
the idea of this company was that UNK UNK processes with visual UNK , etc. , and too close with digital UNK .
and that 's what we did , and we used to make a common advantage for this .
but in the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in UNK and UNK -- which we actually formed the company -- to slow down .
i had written this piece of `` avatar , '' which UNK the UNK in terms of visual effects and UNK UNK , with UNK effects , with realistic human , african-american characters that had been created by UNK , and the UNK should be UNK . and the world should be UNK . and the world should be UNK .
but the truth UNK said , `` okay , '' and the people in my company told me that we 're not going to be able to create that .
so i shifted this and made this other film about the big ship that goes down .
the UNK , i sold that as `` romeo and juliet on a ship , '' it was a UNK UNK UNK , a passionate film .
but secretly , i really wanted to immerse myself in the actual titanic of the titanic .
that 's why i made the film .
that 's truth . the studio did n't know that .
but i convinced you , by saying , `` we come up to the UNK . we movies the real UNK .
we 'll show it in the UNK of the film .
this is hugely important . it 's a good UNK for marketing . ''
and i UNK them to fund a expedition .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to the point that your own imagination can create .
we actually created six months later , a reality in which i put myself in a russian cold parking lot , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and to the real titanic through a UNK .
this was n't a film , not a UNK , that was real .
so , that really blew me .
and the UNK was enormous . we had to do cameras , and we had to make it all the way .
and i fell on , like very UNK , a UNK UNK .
well , they were also UNK and UNK UNK planning .
you go into those capsule , you 're going into this dark , hot environment where there 's no hope to rescue , if you do n't make it back .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's just as much as i would be in a UNK .
that 's really cool . ''
i was really obsessed with the deep ocean .
anyway , from the part that has to do with curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood could n't give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i was going to see outside the UNK .
in some of the reports , i 've seen my creatures in UNK , and sometimes things that i 've never seen before , sometimes the things that no one had ever seen before , and for the science at the time , when we saw it , they had n't found any words .
so that made me really UNK , and i wanted to do more .
and so , i 've been able to do something very unusual .
after the success of `` titanic '' said i said , `` okay , i want to put my UNK in hollywood as a filmmaker in hollywood and i 'm going to UNK for a while . ''
and then we started , we started to the `` UNK , '' and they explored with UNK .
we went back to the titanic of the titanic .
we took little robots that we had built , which was a UNK UNK .
our intent was UNK and to look at the inside of the ship that never had been done before .
nobody had ever explored the inside of the UNK . you had no cure for that . so we developed the technology .
well , i 'm now sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a UNK , and see UNK , which is pretty similar to this UNK here , and i know that once the band had played there .
and i fly with a little UNK through the UNK of the ship .
i 'm actually doing it only , but my consciousness is within the car .
it felt like i 'd be more physically inside the titanic of the titanic .
this was the UNK form of a UNK that i 've ever experienced , because before i 've got a corner of a corner , i 've been thinking about what 's going to be in the UNK of the car , because i was walking around the UNK , when we went to the film .
and the set was , this was an actual copy of the UNK of the ship .
so this was a highly strange experience .
and she made sense of this UNK that you use such UNK avatars and so your own consciousness into the vehicle , into that other form of existence .
it was really quite profound .
and maybe a little bit of view on what might happen in a few decades , if you have UNK to do something , or do other things , in all kinds of UNK UNK , which i can imagine as a UNK .
we began to figure out what we saw in the bottom , really appreciate , for example , for example , this UNK , where we saw these incredibly extraordinary animals . that 's kind of UNK , but here in earth .
they live with the help of UNK .
they do n't exist in a sunlight where we do that .
and this is how you look at the animals that are directly next to the 500 degree centigrade , which you can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in UNK , which was back to the UNK of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and to do that with nasa , sitting in the UNK are sitting in the UNK , and you go to russia , you go to russia , and you go through the mission of UNK protocol , you go to the international UNK , and
that was fascinating .
but at the end of the day , it was out that i took UNK to the deep sea .
and i took them with them , and i put them down to the world here : UNK , UNK , people who are interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources , so that they could look at the sources , they could take samples and test tools and so forth .
so what we did was we did documentaries , but actually , in fact , science said , `` UNK . ''
so the way that the circle around between my existence is UNK , at the time as a child , and UNK into the reality .
and in the course of this class , i 've learned a lot .
i 've learned a lot about science , but i 'm sure you 're now thinking , you know , a director of the director can also lead to a leader like a UNK or something .
but i do n't understand a lot of leadership before i UNK this thing .
because at any point i had to say , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what comes from ? ''
these stinking films do n't give us a money .
we 're just playing the UNK . we 're not going to have a trail .
everybody thought i was between the `` titanic '' and `` avatar , '' and i would have had the nails on a towel on a towel on the beach .
i 've got all these films , these documentaries for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
you 're doing it for the challenge of will , to the challenge , and the ocean is the UNK environment that there is . you make it UNK , and because of the strange connection that arises when a small group of people is a team .
because we 've done all of this with just 10 to 12 people who worked together for years of UNK , and sometimes we were two to three months in the east .
and in that community , you realize that the most important thing is that you have one another , because you have a task that you ca n't explain to any other .
when you go back to land and say , `` we had to do it , the fiberglass , the UNK , the UNK , and the difficulties , the human UNK , if you 're working on the lake , '' you ca n't explain the other . that 's
there 's a connection , one correlation .
so when i came back to turn my next film `` avatar , '' i was trying to use the same thing of reference , which is that you can respect his team and make it in terms of respect .
so this really changed the dynamic .
so , i stood again with a little team at UNK UNK , and we had `` avatar , '' with a new technique that was n't there before .
it 's very exciting .
a great challenge .
and we 've been used to have a UNK , four and a half years .
and it changed my way of doing films , completely .
there was people who said , `` we 'd really have been able to do this kind of UNK and UNK on the planet . ''
for me , it was more a UNK way to do my job , which is the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we end up with all the way ?
what lessons have we learned ?
i think the first thing is that curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that even can create a reality .
and the experience of your teams is more important than any UNK of this world .
to me , young filmmaker , who say , `` give me a advice , how to do something like this . ''
and i say , `` do n't give you one .
you 've got to do this for you . do n't stop you , bet not against yourself . but take risks on you . ''
nasa has a UNK : `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in art , in art , with failure , you have to be an alternative , because there 's a UNK .
not a major endeavor , the innovation passed , has been stopped without risk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
that 's the idea i 'd like to give you with the way . failure is an alternative , fear . thank you .
today , i 'm going to talk to you today about energy and climate .
and this may surprise you , because my UNK UNK at the foundation is basically about vaccines and seed , to make the things that we invent and provide the poorest two billion to make a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
UNK means that their UNK , over many years , is not going to grow over many years . it 's too much or too difficult to rain . things are going to change the way that it ca n't make their existing environment .
this leads to UNK . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to UNK .
so , you 'll get a climate terrible for you .
and also , the UNK is very important for them .
the fact is that , if you could just reduce one thing , to the UNK , energy would be a much more effective one .
well , the UNK is fallen by time .
in fact , the UNK UNK is based on UNK .
the UNK drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a UNK case in the 20th century , and that 's why we have refrigerators , UNK , UNK , we can do modern materials and so many things .
so we 're in a wonderful situation of the world in the rich world .
but , if we cut the price -- let 's get the price half -- we hit a new barrier , and this barrier is depends on co2 .
co2 generates the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
they UNK the UNK co2 , which leads to the UNK , and this UNK has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the unexpected outcome that the natural ecosystems can not be able to adapt , and all of the systems .
well , the exact relationship between a UNK and that makes a UNK UNK , and where they 're going to be UNK , there 's some UNK , but not very many .
and there 's certainly UNK about how bad these are going to be , but they 're going to be extremely bad !
and i asked the UNK times , `` do we really have to get down near zero ?
is n't that half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is : until we get near zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
that 's why it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different from saying , we have to have a 3.5 feet of high truck , which is to get under one three feet of the bridge , and you can sort of like this .
this is going to have to go down the bottom , zero .
well , we 'll run a lot of UNK every year , over 26 billion tons .
every american americans are about 20 tons of people , less than one .
on average , it 's about five tons of any on the planet .
and somehow we have to change changes that lower to zero .
it 's up far now far .
only different economic changes have actually influenced by all , and we need to go from UNK increase to UNK and to one percent to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of UNK . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to get zero zero , and that will be from the number of people , of the service that every human in the average is using the average energy for every
so let 's look at any factor of it , and let 's think about how we get it to zero .
probably one of these numbers must be very close to zero .
now this is the basic algebra , but let 's go through it .
we first have the population .
today 6.8 billion people .
and it 's on nine billion to move on to nine billion .
if we succeeded very successful with new gear , the UNK and UNK , we could probably reduce it to 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we 're going to see a slope of 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this is all the food we eat , clothes , television , heating .
these are very good things and UNK , which means that services to make almost every one on the planet .
it 's great that this number is going up .
in the rich world , in the top of the country , we may be able to make UNK and less use , but in average , this number will go up every year , and in the average , that 's going to be more than double , the number of services that will be put in
so here 's a very fundamental service . there 's a very fundamental service , and there 's a very natural light at home to read the homework ?
and these students do n't have it , they go out and read their UNK under the UNK .
well , by efficiency , the UNK , the energy per service , there is finally good news .
we have something that does n't go up .
because of different successes in UNK , by other UNK , through new techniques of UNK , there are many services services , their charge of some individual services , by 90 percent .
in other users , like the manufacturing of UNK , 105 UNK -- UNK UNK or UNK or UNK , is a lot of UNK for improvement .
all of a sudden , if we 're optimistic , we may have a reduction in a factor of three or maybe even a factor .
but in the first three factors , we 're now from 26 billion to UNK 13 billion tons , and that 's not enough .
so let 's look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a UNK -- that 's the amount of co2 that is UNK per unit .
it turns out the question is , you can get it in zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost any UNK for power today today is co2 , except for renewables and UNK .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need UNK .
now , if i use the word miracles , i do n't mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and services services is a miracle .
people have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
now , there 's no evidence for people to get a miracle to a certain date .
you 're kind of like the only one you 're going to do , and some of them are n't going to
in this case , we have to give up UNK , and we have to get a miracle in very short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i really UNK that ?
is there a natural form of disease , a demonstration , which UNK the idea of people here ?
i reminded me last year , when i got mosquitos , and we kind of liked the people .
the idea was really tangible for them , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
and this is the way that the energy came up with me .
i decided that the UNK of fireflies had to go from fireflies to the environment here .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you told me they 're not surprising , they 're not going to be going to leave the glass .
well , there 's all kinds of UNK like this , but they do n't all get a lot .
we need solutions , either one or a number that has an incredible scale of scaling and incredible UNK , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for it , i really only see five that can afford that big demands .
i have dammed and UNK , merger and merger and biofuels .
these may afford a UNK , and if you afford better than i expect , it would be great , but my statement here is that we must have to work at all those five work , and we ca n't give up a lot of them because they 're
so let 's look at the burning fossil fuels , burning of either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there is , maybe you have to go there , but it 's not . you have to do all the co2 that comes out of the UNK , UNK , UNK , under pressure , and then i hope there 's there .
there are some UNK , which are at a 60 percent -- 80 percent of them , but it 's going to get 100 percent of it , but it 's going to be very difficult to get the UNK of the co2 , but the biggest problem is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is UNK .
who will make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times greater than any kind of waste that you can imagine by UNK and other things ?
that 's a lot of volume .
so this is a hard UNK .
next , UNK .
it also has three big problems . the cost , mostly in UNK countries , are high . the question of certainty that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite the human being that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because even though he 's not very large , there 's a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be soluble , and that 's why you should work .
the last three of the five five , i 've been summarized .
it 's the renewables of renewables as they 're being called often .
and they also have -- although it 's great , they do n't need the fuel -- they have some downsides .
one is the UNK that these technologies produce dramatic as much as UNK .
these are UNK , you 're talking about many UNK , a thousand times more than a normal power station .
and they 're also going to go up with these sources of
the sun does n't seem all the day , it does n't seem any day , and the wind is not always the same .
and that 's why if you have to depend on these sources , you have to have a way to get energy in times if you 're not available .
so there 's big UNK here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say that the energy is outside the country , they do n't need to have the technology , they also need to deal with the risk that the energy from where we
and there 's the UNK .
and to show the dimension , i 've got all kinds of batteries , which are made , looking at cars , computers , mobile phones , mobile phones , UNK , for everything , and that 's the amount of electronic energy that we use , and i found that all the
so what we need here is a big breakthrough here , something that 's going to be a factor of 100 better than the UNK of time .
it 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
this happens when you tried to try and get these UNK sources , say about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to support 100 percent of it , you need an incredible UNK .
now where shall we go , what is the right approach ?
the manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need are many companies working on this . hundreds of companies .
in each of these five regions , we need at least 100 people .
you 're going to say , you 're crazy ! that 's good .
i think here in the ted group there are many who are already engaged .
bill 's big has a number of companies , among other people , UNK the great UNK .
UNK UNK invested in dozens of companies that make great things and interesting opportunities , and i try to support that .
nathan UNK , and i pay a company , which , maybe , is to be a nuclear reactor .
there are some innovations in the UNK ; modular , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a few time ago , so it 's not a great surprise that some good ideas about it .
the UNK means that , instead of a part of the UNK , the one percent , the UNK , we decided to burn 99 percent , the UNK .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you 've been thinking about it long , but you could never be able to simulate an ad , whether it would work , but since there 's modern supercomputers , you can simulate it , and you can see , you know , it 's like the right
and because you burn that 99 percent , it 's very much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste from today to use it as a UNK .
instead of turning the head up , they just burning it . a great thing .
the uranium is burned , a little bit like a candle .
and you can see , it 's a kind of UNK , often as `` the wave reactor . ''
that really does solve the UNK .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , 99 percent . you have the part that 's burned today , so it 's UNK UNK .
this is what the u.s. is UNK for hundreds of years .
and if you 're cheap and UNK and just UNK , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to get forward .
let 's think about how to measure our success .
how should our testimony look like ?
well , let 's go to the goal we have to achieve , and then we 're going to talk about the UNK .
many people talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it 's really very important to get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture , and hopefully , UNK and cement will be clean .
so , to achieve that 80 percent is the developed world , including countries like china , their UNK completely change .
the other note is , if we use the UNK technology , whether they 're used in all developed countries , and we 're on the way to get them to the rest .
that 's great important .
this is going to be a UNK of this UNK .
if we go back from there , what should the 2020 look like ?
it should be the two elements .
we should use the UNK to get reduction in the way . the less we UNK , the less it will be the UNK , and that 's also the temperature .
but actually , this note of the things that we 're doing is not lead to the world that 's not completely connected to the large UNK , just in the same way , or even something less important , which is the UNK of innovation for this innovation .
we have to track this with UNK UNK , and we can measure this : in UNK , in UNK and UNK .
there are many great books in this topic .
the al gore book , `` we have the choice , '' and david UNK UNK UNK the air force .
they really go through and create a frame that can be discussed by this wide , because we need support for all pages .
there are some things that have to come together .
that 's a wish .
a very UNK wish we invent this technology .
if you 'll just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i would love that , or i could choose this wish , which is , UNK UNK , UNK UNK . that 's the best you
this is the biggest impact .
if we do n't get this wish , the dig between the long term and in the short term , people will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich countries , and almost all the life of this two billion will be a lot worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what kinds of action i do ?
we need to use more UNK .
when countries meet in places like UNK , they should n't just talk about co2 .
you should be talking about this UNK UNK , and you would be UNK from the ridiculous little money that you 're going to spend for these innovative ways .
we need UNK , we need co2 , UNK trade trade , something that 's a UNK .
we need to spread the message .
we have to do a UNK and we have to run a UNK and also the things that will be done by the government .
it 's a really important wish , but i think we can satisfy it .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first , can you give us an idea of the size of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation of a supercomputers -- to get all large scientists , what we 've done , we need just a few 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure that it 's
the hard step is to build the first UNK of the first UNK , the UNK , the UNK and the place that actually builds the first of it .
when the first one is finished , if he 's going to go like this , it 's very clear , because the economy , the UNK , is as different as UNK as we know .
so to understand that , that means deep into the soil , almost like an vertical pillar of UNK UNK , that UNK UNK , and then the process starts up , and it starts working down ?
bg : right . today , you have to UNK the reactor , and so many people and lots of the control , that can go wrong . this thing that you can do . this thing is where you opens it and things like
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can get it for 60 years -- think of a column -- they bury it without all the UNK .
and it 's sitting there and burns 60 years , and then it 's finished .
a nuclear reactor , which is an answer for itself .
bg : yes , what happens with the waste : you can sit there -- you can sit there -- there 's a lot of waste with this method -- you take it and put it in the next reactor , and you put it in the next reactor and
and we start by taking the trash , which already exists , which is in these UNK or UNK in the UNK . that 's our UNK .
so what 's been a problem for these reactors was what we fill in our own , and it will dramatically reduce the UNK of this process .
but while you 've been talking about different people of this world ,
where is the largest interest in what really do ?
bg : well , we have n't put ourselves in a place , and there 's a lot of interesting UNK for all the `` nuclear '' in the name , and there are big interest , and the people of the company were in russia , india , china -- i was here , and i 've been talking about the
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have made something in the direction .
this is an alternative of one thing that was made .
this is a very important step forward , but it 's like a faster reactor , and some countries have built this , which is why everybody , who has a fast reactor , is a UNK for our first .
in your idea , UNK and probability really is really going to go into life ?
bg : well , we need one of these UNK , UNK things that are very cheap , we 've got 20 years to invent , and then for 20 years .
and this is like the smartest one that has pointed out of us that we have to do .
and , you know , UNK , if everything is going on , and that 's a great wish , could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of hundreds , which , in the same way , if their approach works , who works for their pilots to do that .
and it would be best if it could create multiple , because you could use a mixture .
every case we need a solution .
UNK the great possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest you know ?
bg : a UNK is UNK .
that would have been , without the UNK , but that makes it so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other cutting-edge companies .
you know , we do n't know their work as good as this , but there 's the modular method , which is a different approach .
there 's a UNK UNK , which seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe they 'll say about us .
and so , there 's different , but the nice thing is , the nice thing about it is that a million times a million times have a million of energy , say , `` if you can relate to the problems , '' and that 's mostly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , the potential , the impact on the country and the
if that does n't work , what ?
do we have to introduce UNK to try and keep the UNK stable ?
bg : if you come to that situation , it 's like you had too much , and you 're just a heart attack , and what do you do ? you might need a UNK or something .
there 's a UNK UNK called UNK , which is UNK with different techniques to UNK the warming , so that we 've been used 20 or 30 years to UNK us .
this is just a UNK .
you 're hoping we do n't need that .
some people say , you should n't have to work on insurance because you might have to do it . you 're going to keep eating it , because you know that you 're going to eat one of the UNK .
i do n't know if you 're smart , if you get the importance of this problem in front of your eyes , but there 's a discourse in UNK about whether you should have that , if things have to be faster , or this innovation needs to be more than we expect .
UNK : do you have one or two sentences for you to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are in very different camps .
the ones that make the scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative effects that do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things they can actually say from which there is a chance in a million .
the UNK here is kind of like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for a lot of them .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of UNK problems in something that you 've only got to invest in something that 's not obvious , that the investment is not the worst scenario , and there 's people in the rich world looking at the usda , and say , okay , that 's not
the fact is that this uncertainty should be concerned about us .
but my dream here is , if you can do it economic , and at the same time you can do the co2 , then the skeptics say , `` okay , i do n't really know that it 's not any co2 , i wish i 'll probably accept that , because it 's
and that would be the answer to the UNK UNK argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other targets of the other goals , the UNK , the UNK of malaria , and so on , that there is a dumb waste of resources , money to invest in
bg : well , the actual spending of research -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion per year more than you do today -- that 's not so dramatic .
you do n't have to suffer from other things .
you go to large UNK , and there 's a reasonable UNK here , if you have something that 's not economic , and it 's trying to fund that . for me , it 's most difficult .
it 's because you 're very short before a UNK and funded just the learning curve , and i think we should try and try to do more things that have the potential , much more powerful .
if you get the UNK , you get a very high UNK , you can only keep up the rich .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times five times as much as our energy without his lifestyle .
the bottom two billion but it 's a disaster .
and even UNK think about .
his new UNK is now : `` why is n't the research that 's going to talk about ? ''
he will still , because of his former stories , with the UNK , but he understood that this is a very controversial group , and that 's why he 's going to get the UNK .
and this is one thing that i think is appropriate .
the research , it 's just crazy to support it .
bill , i believe i 'm talking about almost all people here , if i say , i really hope you 're going to be true . thank you .
bg : thank you .
some years ago , here at ted , peter UNK UNK a UNK called `` the UNK . ''
the idea is quite simple . UNK have to UNK the largest UNK structure with 20 UNK , about UNK scotch tape , about UNK thread and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow needs to be on top .
and even though it really seems to be really hard , it 's really hard to work because people are very easy to cooperate with it .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i put it into a UNK .
it was a huge success .
since then , i 've done about 70 workshops in the world in the world , with students , UNK and architects , even with UNK UNK , and there 's something about this problem with which deep impressions of the nature of working together , and i want to share some of them .
usually , most people start to replicate themselves in terms of the task .
they 're talking about how they 're going to look at what it 's looking like .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they draw and put UNK .
they invest a lot of their time in the UNK and UNK .
and finally , just before you do n't have any time , someone takes the marshmallow , and you put it gently on the top , step back and `` UNK ! '' they admire their work .
but what happens , almost always , is that the `` UNK '' to a `` UNK '' is because the weight of the UNK is that the whole thing is UNK and UNK .
there 's a number of people who have much more UNK UNK than others , and under the worst , they 're UNK .
they lie , they cheat , they 're confused and producing UNK shapes .
and of course , there is teams who have a lot more UNK UNK , and among the best they have a new UNK of UNK .
and that 's pretty amazing .
as peter told us not only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you may be asking is : how is that ? why ? why ? what about those ?
and peter 's saying , `` not one of the kids are spend in UNK UNK at UNK UNK . ''
they do n't invest in UNK .
but there 's another reason .
and that 's that UNK had been trained to find the right plan , ok !
and then you realize it .
what happens then when they put the marshmallow on the top , they do n't have a time , and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
so what UNK UNK is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they UNK the opportunity to UNK prototypes .
UNK recognize these kinds of collaboration as a heart of a UNK .
and with each trial , the children get directly feedback , which works and not .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , really -- but let 's see how different teams operate .
the average of the world is about UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK the half of them , lawyers have a little bit more than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , luckily .
UNK is the highest thing i 've seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and UNK geometric patterns are the key to build robust structures .
ceos are about average . but here 's how interesting .
you get a fixed administrator on the team , you 're going to be much better .
it 's incredible . you look around and you can see , `` this team will win . ''
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special skills of UNK .
they lead the process , they understand it .
and this team that regulates and work on work will improve the performance of our team .
UNK skills and UNK and their combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical way , you get about six , who have robust structures .
so i tried a little bit interesting .
i thought we 're going to get the UNK right .
so i offered a UNK prize for software for the winner .
what do you think happened with this UNK ?
what was the result ?
this one happened . not a team had a robust structure .
if anyone had built a UNK high construction , he would have had taken home .
so is n't it really interesting that high school students have a very powerful effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
so what believe she happened ?
now they understood the benefit of `` UNK . ''
so from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the every time .
so there are UNK lessons for us , about the nature of machine and success .
and you may ask , why would someone actually invest in a time to create a UNK .
the reason is , i 'm going to create digital tools and processes to help teams and create cars , video games and `` UNK UNK . ''
and what the UNK does is , it helps you to identify hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a common experience , a common language , or UNK , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , that simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested , can go to UNK .
it 's a blog where you can see the UNK .
there 's a UNK .
they find crazy examples of all the world in how people optimize the system .
there 's also UNK .
and the UNK lesson , i believe , is actually a UNK sports .
it demands that we all treat our senses at the task , and that we use our thinking fundamentally , like our feelings and our own , in the challenge that we are .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience all the way it needs to bring us from a `` UNK '' -- to a `` UNK '' moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
so let 's do this as if we had a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , UNK machine , and that 's a time time .
and everyone in this room needs to in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you ca n't be in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i 've been asking my friends at the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back in time before they had cars or twitter or `` america is the american . ''
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced you 're kind of a nostalgia , which is UNK .
and that 's what i understand .
i 'm not part of this group , i have to say .
i do n't want to go into the past , and that 's not because i 'm a UNK .
it 's because opportunities in this planet do n't go back , they go ahead .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time we 've ever existed on this planet , no matter how much scale you are doing : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining UNK .
there never had been a time like this .
my UNK died all when they were 60 .
my grandparents urged this number on 70 .
my parents are 80 in the 1960s .
so it should be a nine to the beginning of my UNK .
but it 's not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that is born today in new new delhi is expected to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . that 's an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox : smallpox has killed billion people on this planet .
they have shaped the demographics of the earth in a way that does n't ever have war .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we have UNK them . UNK .
in the rich world , there are millions of diseases that have millions of us in front of just a generation , not yet .
UNK , UNK , UNK ...
anyone knows what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are the successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and look at if it works , it 's going to change it , if it does n't do , one of the great achievement of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , that 's the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they 've been UNK .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements , there 's one billion people in this world go hungry for the world every day .
this number is rising , and it 's very quick , and that 's a shame .
and not only that , we 've used our imagination to UNK this world very much .
drinking water , UNK land , rainforests , the oil , the gas , they disappear , and it 's soon , and if we do n't go out of that chaos , we 'll also disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i do .
and i think it 's clear that we can produce food that will feed a billion people without the land they live in .
i think we can use this world with energy they 're not destroyed at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , this is not a wishful thinking .
but this is awake at me , awake at night -- one of the things that gave me awake at night , and we 've never had scientific progress in the way that we 've never had so desperate for now .
and we 've never been able to do it in UNK UNK , as we can today .
we 're at the verge of amazing , amazing events in lots of places , and yet , i really think that we need to go back hundreds , 300 years before the enlightenment , to find a time where we 've been able to build progress in which we 've had progress , in which we have
people are UNK in their faith , and that 's so intimately that you ca n't escape it .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen , everybody has a right on their opinion , even a right on their opinion , to the progress .
but do you know what they 're not right ?
they do n't have a right on their own facts . UNK , they do n't have .
and i took a while to figure out this .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about UNK for `` the new yorker '' , a little paper .
and i was amazed to hit the resistance , to the resistance of what at the end of the most effective design health in the history of humanity .
i did n't know what to do , so i just did what i 'm doing , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon , i wrote an article about UNK food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote an article about this , and i could n't understand why people thought that would be `` UNK , '' why they believed that molecules would be a certain instead of a random kind of UNK in the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept going .
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
we type , we 're rich , we go food , that 's okay .
but these articles made me worried , and i could n't figure out why , and finally , i found it .
and that 's because these UNK , which i did n't really have any UNK at all .
these were UNK people , educated people , UNK people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that made me so mess .
but then i thought , you know what , we 're honest .
we 're at a point where we do n't have the same relationship with progress as we did .
we 're talking about UNK .
we 're talking ironic this , with little UNK , that 's `` progress . ''
okay , there 's some reason for that , and i think we know what are the reasons that are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes the science is lost , and there 's no reason why it should n't be that way .
you can just call some names , and you can get people .
chernobyl , UNK , the UNK , UNK , mass destruction , the UNK UNK .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we believed they were always right . so be skeptical .
ask questions , ask evidence , require evidence .
take nothing for granted .
but now comes : if you have to get evidence , you have to suppose this evidence , and we 're not good .
and i can say that we 're now saying in an epidemic of fear , like i 've never seen before , and hopefully never will see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a horrible story that UNK the UNK with the UNK , UNK , UNK UNK .
very frightening .
tons of studies have been done in order to see if that was true .
tons of studies need to be done ; that 's serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , none .
it does n't make any difference . it does n't make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe we believe what we 're seeing , what we think we 're going to see .
we do n't believe in a bunch of documents from a UNK that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was devastating .
and even more than that : the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world where UNK UNK UNK .
this is UNK , and we should be ashamed .
it 's terrible .
what happens is that we could do this .
well , i understand that . i do it .
because anybody got UNK here ?
has one single audience ever seen in UNK UNK ?
do n't happen very often .
does n't happen in this country at all , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
these are many deaths from UNK , 20 per hour .
but because this is n't happening here , we can think of it , and people can be UNK , and people can be UNK and UNK messages from fear and UNK of platforms like oprah and larry king live in retrospect .
and they can do that because they do n't connect the cause and correlation .
you do n't understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same thing .
and that 's something we need to learn , and that 's very quick .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he liberated us from one of the worst UNK of humanity .
no fear , no hiking , UNK , UNK , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he 's called paul UNK .
he just developed a couple of other people with a UNK .
he can save the life of UNK , 500,000 kids per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that 's good , apart from what paul UNK and UNK talks about , and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop UNK .
and that 's what he actually says .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul speaks in a public UNK , he ca n't know with the UNK of the UNK .
he gets calls home at home because people like to tell him you know where to go to school .
and why ? because paul has done a vaccine .
i do n't need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
take them on , go back to the disease , horrible diseases , and this is happening right now .
we 've got UNK in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not only dying at UNK .
what about UNK ? let 's do that . why not ?
a UNK of me wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said , `` i 'm a little bit of UNK . ''
nobody ever said that before .
she would not vaccinate her child against UNK . absolutely not .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't have a UNK , and you know what ?
we had no UNK in this country yesterday .
now , i do n't know , maybe this morning someone in lagos , in a flight , is just going to los angeles , right now he 's about ohio .
and in a couple of hours , he goes and UNK a car , and he 's going to go to long beach , and he 's going to go to one of these UNK UNK tonight .
and he does n't know that he 's infected with a UNK disease , and we do n't know that , because that 's how the world works .
this is the planet where we live . do n't do it as if he 's not .
we love to UNK us in lying . we love that .
do you have all the vitamins in this morning ?
UNK , a little UNK , who is going to help you on the rubble .
i know you did that because half the americans do that every day .
they take this stuff , and they take an alternative cure , and it does n't make any difference , how often we can figure out that they 're useless .
this data is UNK all the time .
they do their urine . they 're almost never .
that 's okay , you 'd like to want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark .
i 'm very happy to tell you .
darkness . darkness .
why are we doing this ? why are we doing this ?
well , i believe i understand -- we hate the UNK .
we hate a strong government . we do n't have confidence in the system .
and we should n't do that . our health system is UNK .
it 's gruesome to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and UNK even to us that can afford it .
so we 're running out before , and where are we going to run ?
we 're running into the poor of the UNK .
that 's great . i love the UNK .
but you know , this is really serious business , because the stuff is crap , and we give a billion dollars for it .
and i 've got all kinds of little artifacts here .
none of it -- UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , i do n't even know what this is , but we 'll give a billion dollars for it , it 's cheating .
and you know what ? if i say that , you shout me , and say , `` what do you want ? let people do what they want .
that 's how they feel good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because i do n't care about whether it 's the minister of defense , who says , `` hmm , i 'm not going to suppose the evidence of my experts in UNK or some UNK who wants to treat his patients with UNK .
if you 're moving on this path , where believe and magic replace some evidence and science , you get to a place where you do n't want to be .
they get to UNK UNK in south africa .
he brought 400,000 people around , because he insisted that red UNK , UNK and UNK are much more efficient than antiretroviral drugs , of which we know that they can be able to understand the process of aids .
hundreds of thousands of UNK deaths from a country , which is worse than any other disease .
do n't tell me these things do n't have any consequences .
they have . they always have .
now , the UNK epidemic in which we 're currently in , is this ridiculous struggle between the UNK UNK , and the UNK .
this is a UNK debate . it must stop .
it 's a debate about words , talking about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
all we eat , every UNK , every branch UNK , every UNK , was changed by people .
you know , there was no UNK in paradise .
there was no UNK .
we did n't have any UNK . we did all this .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of it did n't work and some of it .
we get rid of what 's not working .
now we can do it in a more moment , and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to increase millions of people , to increase their lives .
you do n't want to do that ?
i have to say , i do n't understand that .
we reject UNK food .
why are we doing this ?
well , what i hear is all the time : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , UNK , UNK , we do n't want to have huge areas with one thing that is wrong .
we do n't want companies to patent lives .
we do n't want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer on all of that is ?
yes , they 're right . we fix it .
it 's true , we have a huge UNK , but that 's not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
it 's right , morality , UNK .
you know that science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
she 's a process , and sometimes he works and sometimes not , but the idea of the idea that we should n't allow science to do , because we 're afraid is a really UNK , and it 's holding millions of people from UNK .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have to grow 70 percent more food than currently , 70 percent .
that investment in africa over the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
you need that , and we do n't give them .
and why ? UNK changed food .
we do n't want to encourage people to eat this UNK stuff , like UNK .
UNK is something that eat one billion people .
it 's kind of like a jam .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's UNK .
it does n't have nutrients , it does n't have any protein , and scientists are building all of that in it .
and then people could eat the food and would not be blind .
you would n't be starvation , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it would n't be UNK UNK , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say , why are we fighting ?
i mean , ask us , why are we fighting this ?
because we do n't want to UNK the genes ?
it 's not about genes UNK . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our UNK to bigger food , better food , unique food .
it 's not about UNK UNK , it 's about preserving people alive , and it 's going to be very time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do that , if we 're going to do so far , we 're going to make a little bit guilty about this , i believe , i believe , not to be guilty , like high-tech colonialism .
there is no other description for what 's happening here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's not UNK , and we really have to stop it .
so after this incredible funny conversation , you might want to say , `` do you still want to go into this ridiculous time time and go into the future ? ''
absolutely . that 's what i want to do .
right now , it 's in the present moment , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can ask this time to all the time .
we can UNK them , where we want them to be UNK , and we 'll move them into where we want to .
we need to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but we need to think , but if we go into the time time and go into the future , we 'll be happy to have that .
and i know we can , and as far as it comes to me , it 's something that needs the world now .
thank you .
thank you .
so for some time , i 've been interested in the UNK . it may seem strange that a magician was interested in that , because , you know , you 're looking at it like me , as `` a deception that will be something real if someone only believes in it . ''
in other words , UNK in some studies have shown a measurable effect in some studies , the UNK , and that 's why the person is thinking about what 's going to do with her , is an eighteenth or a kind of -- in UNK , for example , if the patient only believes in the body , there 's a measurable effect in the body
one deception becomes something real because someone else sees it .
so we can also understand each other , and i want to show you now a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and i 'm going to show you how he works . this is a trick that 's at least since the 1950s on every time of the children .
i even learned him from UNK UNK magic tricks in the 1970s .
i 'm going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i 'll explain why i 'll explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife can be looking at ; my hand you can study .
i 'm just going to keep the knife in my own .
i 'm putting my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve goes out or out of it , i 'm just going to UNK my wrist on here .
so , in this way , you can see that there 's no time to go . and as long as i do n't know , it ca n't go into my sleeve or get out .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to open up my hand , and hopefully , if everything comes up , the knife will go through my taste of physical UNK .
it 's actually so stuck in its place that i can shake it without the knife UNK .
nothing goes into my sleeve or comes out , not UNK . and you can study anything .
UNK !
well , this is a trick that i often UNK kids , who are interested in magic , because you can learn how much about deception when you 're going to look closely , even though it 's a very simple trick .
probably many of you in the room now know this trick .
so , here 's how it works .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say i 'm going to UNK my wrist , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve goes out or coming out , and that 's a lie .
the reason i UNK my wrist is that the actual secret of illusion is .
in the moment , where i UNK my hand of you , so you can see it from the back , my finger , my UNK , just from where he was , in a position where he was so UNK .
great trick ?
in the back , someone who has n't had a childhood .
so , he 's here . right .
and when i UNK , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you do n't know that there 's only three fingers in the bottom , because the mind and the way he brain information is n't really important , one , two , three , but it 's as a group
but that 's not what 's all about here . and then i open my hand .
of course it will be put in there , but not through the UNK of my body , but through a trick with my UNK , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens when i UNK myself , by this movement is UNK , that the finger UNK itself .
i take that hand . and here 's the knife .
this trick can show you with your friends and your neighbors . thank you .
now , what has this to do with the UNK ?
one year or so , i read a study that really blew me away .
i 'm not a doctor or researchers , and that was an amazing thing for me .
and what turns out is that if you were offering a UNK in a form of a white pill in the form of a UNK , it 's just a round , white pill that has a particular measurable effect .
but if you have the shape that you give the UNK , for example , in a smaller pill , and this blue uniform , and a letter about it , is actually more efficient .
and that , despite any UNK , they 're just UNK .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? it really struck me .
but it turns out that 's not anything .
if you 're looking inward , that 's even more effective than any form of each form .
a colored capsule that is at one end yellow and the other red is better than a white capsule .
the UNK plays a role .
a pill two every day is not as good as three pills -- i ca n't remember the exact statistics . i 'm sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
... that the UNK is a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate UNK , you have to take to the needle .
right ? a syringe with a UNK -- some UNK of a UNK substance that you put in a patient .
that makes a very powerful image in your head . that 's much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'll show you a different time when we have a UNK .
so the fact is that the white pill does n't seem as good as the blue pill that does n't seem as good as a capsule as a capsule as it does n't like the needle .
and none of that has any really important property . it 's only our faith in which we can make a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i 'll take something that 's obviously a deception , and let 's get it real .
we know from the study that you have to reach to the needle , if you 're going to go to the needle .
this is a UNK long UNK . it 's very , very UNK . and i 'm going to leave you a little bit .
and this is really my flesh . it 's not UNK , special UNK flesh .
this is my skin . this is not a UNK from hollywood .
i 'm going to put this needle in my skin in my skin and go through it , until you put it back on the other side .
if you 're evil -- if you fall down in UNK -- i put some friends of the night in the hotel room , and some people i did n't know , and that 's almost UNK a woman .
so i propose , if you 're going to go away very bad , then you 're going to look out for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i 'll do the first UNK part here in the back .
you can see it in the same time , but you can also UNK , if you like .
so , it goes like this , right here where my flesh starts , at the bottom of my UNK , i 'll just make a little UNK .
i 'm sorry . does it make it nuts ?
and just a little bit of a little bit through my skin and on the other hand .
now we 're actually in the same situation that we had in UNK .
about this .
but now you ca n't count my finger , right ?
so , i 'll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yes .
i know what people think when you see this .
they say , `` okay , this is not so stupid and UNK itself , just to entertain the skin , just to entertain us for a few minutes . ''
well , i 'll show you .
so what does this look like ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and the people in the back say , `` okay . i did n't see that right . ''
people in the UNK are coming in .
let me show you from near .
this is really my skin . this is not a UNK from hollywood .
that 's my flesh , and i can do this .
sorry . if you 're bad , you 're looking away , look at it .
the people in the back , the people that later on the back of the street , say , `` well , this is quite incredible , but if it was real , he would -- you see , here 's a hole and there , if it really would be , it would be UNK . ''
okay , let me UNK a little bit for you .
yes , here it is .
now , usually i would take the needle now .
and i would show my arm , and i would show you that there 's no wounds .
but i think , in this frame , here and with the intent of making a real real , i 'm going to just walk the needle and go through the stage .
we 'll get some time in the next few days .
i hope you 're very happy . thank you .
everybody is talking today about happiness today .
i have a couple of people count the number of books that have been published with `` UNK , '' in the last five years , and they gave up about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there 's an enormous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there 's a lot of UNK .
everybody would love to make people happier .
but despite all these places of work , there are several cognitive ones that are kind of almost impossible to do , to think of happiness .
and my talk today is going to act mainly from these cognitive ones .
this is true for UNK , which is thinking about their own happiness , and it 's true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out that we are just as malleable as everyone else .
the first one of these fall is a UNK , complexity .
it turns out the word happiness is simply not a useful word , because we apply it to lots of different things .
and i think there 's a particular meaning that we could cause it to , but in the big and all the way is that something we need to give up , and we 'll have to think of the complicated view of what is well-being .
the second trap is an experience of experience and memory : basically , you 're going to be between happy in his life and happy to his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they 're both UNK in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the UNK , and that 's the obvious fact that we do n't think about one way to think about it , that we can not be able to think about it , that we ca n't think about it , to distort , without meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there 's just no way to get it right .
now , i 'd like to start with one example of someone who had a UNK UNK , one of my lectures , who said a story . [ unclear ] he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and at the end of the time , it was a UNK UNK
and then he added , really , really emotionally , that has experienced the whole experience .
but it did n't have it .
what it ruins was the memories of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had had 20 minutes of UNK music .
they 're not UNK because he was UNK with a memory ; the memory was ruins , and the memory was all he had to keep .
what 's really telling us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people , in the sense of two ways of self .
there 's a UNK self that lives in the present , and the presence of the present is capable of experience the past , but basically just the present .
it 's the UNK self that the doctor UNK -- you know , when the doctor says , `` do it painful , if i put them here ? ''
and then , there is a UNK self , and the UNK self is that UNK UNK and the story of our lives , and it 's the person who 's UNK the doctor , by asking the question , `` how did you feel in the last time ? ''
or , `` how was your journey for albania ? '' or something like that .
these are two very different entities , the UNK self and the UNK self , and the UNK self , is part of the UNK of the state of happiness .
well , the UNK self is a storyteller .
and that really begins with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it begins immediately .
we do n't just tell stories when we do to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we 're allowed to do with our experiences is a story .
and let 's do UNK with one example .
there 's an old study .
these are real patients who participate in a painful .
i 'm not going to go to the detail . she 's not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds across the pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they 're going to ask you , `` who of both have more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient b is clearly suffered . his UNK was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a had a patient , a patient had a patient , and more .
but now there 's a different question : `` how very did these patients thought that they were there ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a a much more UNK UNK to the UNK than a patient had b .
the stories of UNK were different , and because a very important part of the story is , as it ends .
and none of these stories is very UNK or great -- but one of them is UNK .
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the worse , the worse , where the pain was at the end of its peak , it 's a bad story .
how do we know this ?
because we asked these people after UNK , and also a lot later , `` how bad was the whole thing to do ? ''
and she was much worse for a than a UNK in UNK .
well , this is a direct conflict between the UNK self and the UNK self .
from the UNK point of view , b is clearly a UNK time .
now , what you could do with a patient , and we 've actually done clinical trials in actually , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually actually make the UNK of the patient a , by just UNK the tube in without very much UNK .
this will lead to the patient , but just a little bit , and much less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you do n't have the UNK self from the patient a a worse one , and you have that the UNK self is a much better , because now you have a better history of his experience .
what distinguishes a story ?
and this is true for the stories that the memory provides us , and it 's also for the stories we invent .
and what happens to be a story of UNK is UNK , great moments and end .
end is very , very important , and in this case , the end is UNK .
well , the UNK self is always alive .
it has moments of UNK , one after the other .
and they ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i 've been doing this -- you know , the psychological presence for about three seconds , which means , you know , there 's about 600 million of it . in a month , there 's about 600,000 , in a month of
most of them are completely ignored by the UNK themselves .
and yet , they kind of get the sense that they should count , that what happens during the moments of the UNK is our lives .
it 's the resources that we consume while we are in the world .
and as we consume it , it seems to be important , but that 's not the story that makes the UNK self .
so we have the UNK self and the UNK self , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is at time .
from the UNK point of view , if you have a holiday , and the second week is just as good as the first week , that UNK UNK is twice as good as the UNK holidays .
that does n't work at all for the UNK self .
for the UNK self , a UNK house is barely better than UNK holidays , because there 's no new memories to be added .
you have n't changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable , which is a UNK itself from a UNK self , and time has very much influence on this story .
well , the UNK self is more than to remember and telling stories .
it 's actually UNK that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , you say , you know , if you had two UNK at two different surgeons , and decide what to choose , that 's the person who has the memory that 's less bad , and that 's the surgeon who is
the UNK self has no voice in that choice .
in fact , we do n't choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we do n't usually think about our future as a experiences .
we think about our future , as a UNK memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as an tyranny of the UNK self , and you can think of the UNK yourself as one , which is kind of like the UNK self UNK through experiences that the UNK self does n't need .
i have the sense that if we 're doing holidays , it 's very common , that 's what we 're doing , and we 're going to do a UNK in services of the UNK self .
and that 's a little bit difficult to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the UNK self .
and when i think about it , i think about a holiday that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best holiday i had ever had , and i think quite often about how often i think about other UNK .
and i probably have my memories of this UNK journey , and i 'd say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i 've ever had the folder open up with the 600 images , i 'd spent another hour .
well , that 's three weeks , and that 's for a second and a half .
there seems to be a disagreement .
well , i like to be a little bit extremely , you know , in how much UNK i put on the UNK of memories , but even if you 're going to do more of it , why are we going to do a real question . why are we giving memories of that much weight in the UNK of the
and so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the UNK , you 're all UNK your pictures , and you get a UNK drug , so you ca n't remember anything .
well , would you choose the same holidays ?
and if you would choose another holiday , there 's a conflict between your two ways of self , and you have to think about how you 're going to decide that conflict , and that 's really not obvious , because if you 're thinking about time , you can think of an answer , and if you can think of the sense of
now , why we choose the UNK we choose is a problem that makes us choice between the two species of self .
now , the two ways of self , just throw out two terms of happiness .
in fact , there are two concepts of the happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask , how are the UNK self ?
and then you would ask , how are the moments of the life of the UNK self ?
and you 're all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we 're now able to get a pretty good idea to get the happiness of the UNK self over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the UNK , it 's a very different thing .
this is not a person who lives a person .
it 's like satisfied or pleased to the person when that person believes in your life .
very different idea .
everybody who does n't relate these terms of happiness to the study of happiness , and i belong to a lot of researchers about well-being that have spent the study of happiness in the same way .
the distinction between the happiness of the UNK self and the happiness of the UNK itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you 're going to be trying to measure the two .
the UNK organization gave a global survey , where more than one million people have been asked to ask about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there was other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of the two species of self .
and the main lesson that we have , i believe , is that they 're really different .
you can know how someone is with your life , and you do n't really teach them a lot about how he lives his life and the vice versa .
just to give you a sense of conducive to the correlation that correlation is about UNK .
what that means is that if you hit someone and you would say , oh , his father is a UNK , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you 'd know something about its size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone 's life as eight on a scale of 10 UNK , they have a lot of uncertainty about how he 's happy with his UNK itself .
so correlation is low .
we know something about what the happiness of the UNK determines .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness means mostly , being satisfied with people we like , and we love with people we like .
there 's other pleasure , but that 's dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two , you want to do very different things at the end .
and the implication of what i said here is that we really do n't really have to imagine happiness than a lot of well-being .
it 's a completely different idea .
well , quite short , another reason we ca n't really realize about happiness , that we ca n't be aware of the same things when we 're thinking about life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how do the people in california are not going to get the right answer .
if you ask this question , you think that people have to be happier in california if they are , say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the UNK self , and it 's not even very important to the UNK self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the UNK self is responsible , you can end up with the end -- some people could move at the end of california .
and it 's kind of really interesting to track , what happens to people that go to california to be happier in hope .
well , your UNK self will not become happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you 'll think you 're happier , because if you 're going to think about it , you 'll think about how terrible the weather was in ohio , and you feel you 've made the right decision .
it 's very difficult to think of well-being , and i hope i 'll give you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you very much .
now , when we came up with a couple of weeks ago , they had to tell me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came from this UNK poll .
is this something that you can share with us , because you 've got a couple of minutes left here ?
daniel UNK : safe .
i think the most interesting thing we found in the UNK survey is a number that we did n't have to find .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the UNK self .
if we were looking at how to UNK the income of income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a large representative sample , under every income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are people unhappy , and they 're getting more stable , the poorer they will .
we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i 've barely seen the flat lines .
what happens is , obviously , that money does n't pick any UNK , but that lack of money , in a certainly , bought any misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the UNK self , you get a different story .
the more money you deserve , you 're more powerful .
it 's not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american UNK is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this idea seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , all the way we believe , for example , in terms of creation and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , in general , is that the country is generally an example of how to take care of that , and that would be based on politics ?
dk : you know , i think it 's recognition for the role of UNK in politics .
the recognition is going to be slow in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it 's just happening in and in other countries .
the people are , UNK , that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it 's going to be a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to look at UNK , or whether they want to look at UNK , so we have to get this discussion pretty soon .
how to happiness is very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the UNK self or whether you think about the UNK self .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the years .
in the united states , they 're UNK to measure the population of the population .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades , to be part of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me that it 's going to be this topic , or at least the most important political debate will be for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny UNK .
i 'm jane mcgonigal . i love video games .
i 've been thinking about 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it just as easy to make the world in reality , to save the world in UNK .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of them , to spend more time playing greater and UNK games .
we 're going to spend three billion hours a week in UNK .
some of you may think , `` that 's a whole lot of time for games . ''
maybe a lot of time when you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the department of the future , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most significant problems in the world .
and in fact , i 'm convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to improve this time .
i 've done UNK that it took time for 21 billion hours a week .
now this might seem to be a little bit of UNK , so i 'll repeat that , so i 'll repeat that , if we can do problems like hunger , poverty , poverty , global conflict and obesity , i believe , we have to try and play games for at least 21 billion hours a week
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this image is quite exactly why i believe that games are so important to survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a photograph of the photographers UNK UNK .
he wanted to capture the emotion at play , so he created a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you 're not a player , you may be able to get some of the UNK in this image .
you 're probably looking at this sense of urgency , a bit more fear , but also very serious concentration , the way to solve a real problem .
if you 're also playing , you 're looking at some UNK here , the UNK eyes , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player on the edge of one called UNK UNK .
oh , you know that . okay . okay . okay , we have some players here .
a UNK victory is a result that is so extremely beneficial , that they did n't even know it was possible .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and when they achieve it , they 're shocked to actually be something like this . that 's a UNK victory .
that player stands in front of a UNK victory .
and this is what we have to see in millions of faces of UNK around the world , if we take the silos of the next century to attack , the face of those who are on the edge of all odds on the edge of a UNK UNK .
well , unfortunately , we 're looking at this face in real life , when we face difficult problems .
i call it `` in life , i am bad '' UNK , and it 's my face , you know , look ? yes ? ok .
that 's me , like , `` in life , i am bad . ''
this is a graffiti in my former home home to berkeley , california , where i was in play , in play , in play better than in real life .
this is a problem that has many players .
we think we 're not as good as in play .
and i do n't just want to succeed less than that .
we 're going to get more in UNK . i mean good at the context of the motivation , to do something very long , inspired to collaboration .
if we 're in a UNK , i believe that many of us are going to turn into our best version , anytime and immediately UNK , UNK the problem to solve the problem , as long as necessary to try and try to try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try
and in the reality of reality , if we fail , if we go to obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel deeply overwhelmed . we feel defeated , we feel under threat , maybe , perhaps depressed , frustrated or UNK .
we never have a sense of that when we play games , they do n't just have them .
and that 's what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it not possible in play , thinking , you could n't just get anything ?
how can we make these feelings of play into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment to our collaborative problem .
and i found some things that epic UNK in UNK are so possible .
so , first of all , if you get into one of these pieces of media , especially in the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are willing to give you a UNK mission .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
so you create this .
they never get a job they can not solve .
but always on the edge of your skills , so you have to work . but there is no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you 're not sitting around and you click UNK . there 's always a very important thing to do .
and there are tons of employees .
wherever you go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them work together to get their epic mission .
we do n't have a sense of that in the real life , that sense of UNK UNK people .
and also , there is this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
and we 'll get this whole positive feedback .
they 've heard about `` level high '' and `` plus-one strength , '' or `` plus-one intelligence . ''
that constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i do n't have any argument : plus-one the world , plus-one crazy idea , UNK crazy idea .
i do n't get your feedback in the real life .
so , the problem of UNK , like world of warcraft , is that it 's so UNK , at the edge of a UNK UNK , that we prefer to spend our entire time in these UNK .
they 're just better than reality .
until today , all the world of UNK UNK had spent millions of years together to solve the virtual problems of UNK .
that 's not necessarily bad .
it may sound bad .
but to look at it in the context , UNK million years ago , our first UNK began to go to go .
so the first one is UNK .
all right , so if we talk about it , how much time we 're going to talk about play with play , it 's only sense when you 're in terms of time in terms of human development in terms of human development in terms of human development , which is right .
but also right . because it turns out to be using all of this time to play , actually what we 're going to do as people .
we are developing to collaborative , very much creatures .
that 's truth . i believe in that .
look at this interesting statistic , which was recently published by a researcher at the carnegie mellon university university : the average young man of today in a country with large UNK , spent 10,000 hours with UNK , in the age of 21 .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number , two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , there are UNK hours of the exact UNK that they spend in school , from five to the high school , to the high school high school .
so , we 've got a complete UNK , in the young people as well as to learn what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book from malcolm gladwell , `` UNK . ''
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great science of UNK , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the UNK study of any subject to the 21 of the day , we are going to UNK .
we 're going to be so good at doing whatever the most significant people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are UNK .
so the big question is , `` what are players doing good ? ''
because if we could find this out , we 'd never actually have a UNK of UNK human potential .
so many people we have in the world right now , at least one hour a day with UNK .
these are our UNK . 500 million people who are extraordinary good in `` something . ''
and in the next decade , we have another billion players , which are extraordinary good in whatever .
if you do n't 've heard it ,
the UNK developed UNK that save energy and work on UNK , rather than UNK , so that players around the world , especially in india , china , china , you can play online .
you 'd expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have a 1.5 billion player .
so , i started to think about what it is , what it is to be the UNK of these games .
these are the four things i found . first of all , UNK .
all right , imagine the extreme UNK .
UNK is the desire to do , immediately to do a challenge , together with the belief that we have a UNK hope for success .
players always believe that a UNK victory is possible , and it 's always worth trying to try and do it .
players are n't sitting around .
players are masters in the spiders of social networks .
there 's a lot of interesting studies , which show you that we kind of like people , after all , when we played with them , even if they defeated us bad .
the reason for that is that there needs a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that somebody else with us spends the rules that the rules are going to be UNK , that we have the same goal , and to the end of it .
so the game allows you to grow up of ties and trust and each other .
as a consequence of that , we build stronger social relationships .
UNK productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why the UNK of UNK UNK UNK 22 hours a week , kind of like UNK .
the reason is that , if we 're playing , we 're actually happier at work at work hard than if we 're blinded or not .
we know that we 're working as human beings , if we do hard , very much work .
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to be part of the UNK of the UNK of the UNK .
so here 's a UNK UNK to get this in the right light . you 've seen all wikipedia , the largest UNK of the world .
the second largest UNK UNK in the world , with almost sexually frost , is the world of warcraft .
five million people are using it every month .
they have UNK more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other subject in any other subject in any other UNK in the world .
they create an epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
all right , so these are four superpowers to lead to a single outcome . players are UNK , hopeful individuals .
it 's people who believe that they can be able to change the world .
and the only problem is they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i 'm trying to solve .
edward UNK is a UNK .
his work is brilliant . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in UNK .
and he says , `` we 're going to become more than a UNK of a UNK in virtual worlds and UNK . ''
and this is an economist , and so he logical .
and he says ...
it 's not like me -- i 'm working games , i 'm a little UNK .
so he says that makes sense , because players can achieve more in UNK than in real life .
they can create more powerful social bonds in play than in real life , and they get more feedback and reward in play in the real life .
so , he said , it 's perfectly logical that there are more time in the virtual world than in the real time .
i do n't even think that 's logical .
but it 's definitely not a UNK .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that UNK 2,500 years .
there 's this UNK cube , from UNK . you know ?
before this fantastic UNK , it was UNK .
and they were kind of like the first one of people developed UNK .
and if you 're familiar with the UNK of the old greek UNK , you may be familiar with this story . the story of how and why games have been invented .
loud UNK got games , more specifically UNK , in the kingdom of UNK during an famine .
supposedly , there was such great famine that the king of UNK was in a crazy idea .
the people was slavery . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you need a extreme solution .
so they invented , according to UNK , UNK UNK , UNK a national strategy , a day you would eat . the next day you would play . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much going into the UNK patient , because games are so fascinating and UNK with UNK , UNK productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play , and the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to UNK , they survived these years for 18 years by eating a day in a day and was the next one .
so , i think we 're going to put games today .
we put games together to escape the suffering of the real world .
we 're going to put games together to avoid everything that does n't work in the real world , everything that 's not UNK in the real life , and we 'll get what we need to play .
but it does n't have to be the end .
that 's the exciting thing .
according to UNK , after 18 , the famine was n't better . so the king , the king , was UNK .
they shared the kingdom of two halves .
they played a UNK and the winner could break down to a UNK adventure .
they left UNK , and they put themselves looking for a new home , and they just took so many people back to the way that food was going to survive , and they were looking for the rest of a area where they could thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest UNK show show that the UNK , which later , was the UNK rich , the same dna as the old UNK .
so scientists , recently , came to the notion that UNK is actually UNK .
and geologists found the evidence of a global UNK , which was almost 20 years trying to explain .
so this could voices this crazy story .
you may actually have the people in play by play , by UNK for 18 years in games , and then they had these UNK , and so much about the way that they had to play with each other , that they had
so , we can do that .
we 've been playing in 1994 for 1994 .
this was the first UNK in real time in the world of UNK . this was 16 years ago .
they played UNK for 18 years for UNK , we 've been playing for 16 years of warcraft .
i 'm going to say we 're ready for our own UNK game .
so , they sent half of their civilization on the looking for a new world , which is why i take my 21 billion UNK per week .
we should be told that half of us spend an hour a day with play , until we solved the problems of the real world .
i know you 're going to ask , `` how do we solve problems in the real world ? '' and exactly that question , i 've been devoted to my work in the last few years at the center for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , which we should understand the future .
we do n't want to try and say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible outcome , and then people are going to try to make this idea into reality .
we imagine epic UNK , and we give people the opportunity to achieve it .
i 'll show you very short three games that i 've designed to try to try and try and make people epic in their own future .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
the game is in 2007 .
it 's a UNK that you have to overcome a UNK .
the UNK is invented , but we have enough UNK , so that it will be realistic for them , and they actually do their real life without the game , say where they live , and then they get UNK in real time , to show you how much oil is , if you are
we tested this game with UNK players in 2007 , and we 've been doing it since over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it 's good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you 're in a UNK adventure , and you 're said , `` we 're going to do the oil . ''
this is a fascinating adventure to go on .
find out how to survive , most of our players have played in the game of UNK behavior .
so , we 've got a bigger UNK game for the next one , higher goal than just UNK .
we created the game `` UNK '' at the center for the future .
the point is that the calculation of a UNK , that people have only left 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputers is called `` global UNK UNK , '' of course .
the call to the player , to UNK , we have UNK UNK .
they 're going to know jerry UNK , where the `` UNK '' is there , you have the astronauts , the scientists , the UNK , and just together , you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everybody is in the UNK , and it 's our quest to create the future of energy , food , security , and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read , when they 're reading `` UNK . ''
and the last game we 're going to do in march third . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get from the world bank , the distinction of `` social UNK , '' by 2010 .
we work with universities in sub-saharan africa , and they invite them to learn social in the world .
we have a comic comic book . we have a level of high school for UNK , UNK , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i 'd like to invite you all to share this game with young people everywhere in the world , especially in UNK , which are able to imagine their own social enterprise to save the world .
i 'll end up with the end .
i want to ask you something .
what , you believe , is happening next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have n't saved the real world .
well , i hope you 're hoping that players are human resources that we can use to work in the real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , UNK productivity , the ability to knit strong social networks , UNK and demand for UNK .
i really hope that we play large games together to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you 're going to play with me like this and play .
if i 'm going to UNK in the next decade , i 'm sure that we can create any UNK future , and we can play all sorts of games .
so i 'll say , let 's start the UNK games !
thank you .
and i 'd like to tell you something that a couple of months ago , i 'd like to write a journal of music for a journal of wired magazine .
i 've always been writing my UNK , but i was already done with the edit of the UNK , and i noticed that i 've never been UNK in my life that the word `` UNK '' really means .
i read you the post .
`` UNK , '' UNK : `` UNK , helpless , useless , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK
UNK : healthy , strong , UNK . ''
i read this list of a friend loud read , and i had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i was just going to have been UNK , and i was n't going to have a UNK , and i had to stop reading this UNK UNK , and
of course , this was a UNK , old UNK . i just thought that the copy has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early '80s , when i was just starting with elementary school and started to create my sense of my family outside of my family , in terms of other children and to the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i did n't use any UNK at this time .
if i would take this post serious , i would be born in a world that someone like me , as a person , would be able to be able to get a difference in UNK , but now i 'm going to have the opportunity for the opportunities that i 've experienced .
so , i immediately came up with the UNK of 2009 , and i expected that i was going to find a UNK in there .
here 's the UNK version of this UNK .
unfortunately , it 's not much better .
and in particular , the last two words , in particular , is the last two words under `` near UNK '' `` all '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just about the words .
it 's about what we think about people we 're describing with these words .
it 's about the values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many of the UNK societies , including the greeks and the guinea , have really believed that the UNK of a UNK has a great power because what you can do with UNK .
so , what do we want to do with UNK -- UNK people , or powerful people ?
you know , just a human being UNK as a child , could be enough , they 're UNK and UNK .
would n't it be nice to open up the doors ?
a man who has opened up for me before the doors was my assistant at the UNK , leaving the UNK in UNK in UNK .
he 's called dr. UNK . a UNK , whose name , as you can think , was that most americans could n't be accurate . so he was always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. UNK was always going to fly very colorful , and it was just for work with kids just like created .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great -- until my UNK .
i had to hear individual exercises at all the time with this UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK -- in different colors -- you know , in different colors -- and i hated that UNK more than anything . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it .
and imagine yourself as a UNK child with dr. p. negotiate and tried to stop these exercises , UNK without success .
and one day he 'd been looking at me in one of my exercises -- these exercises were just tiring and UNK -- and he said to me , `` wow , UNK , you 're so strong , very strong and young girl , you 're going to get one day of one of these UNK .
and if you can make it , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
that was , of course , just a simple trick from dr. p. , so i do the exercises that i did n't want to do , with the prospect of that richest young girls in the hospital are going to be in the second floor , but he actually led me to see my daily UNK with new eyes . that 's how it was
and i 'm asking myself today , how much his vision of me as strong and powerful young girl has been shaped my body , and i could think of myself as a natural , powerful and UNK human .
this is just one example of how adults can be able to prompt the imagination of a child .
but like the already quoted examples of the UNK prove that our language does n't give us a space , something that we all would want to do , to allow every single one to to see themselves as powerful people .
our language presents the social changes , which has been triggered by a technological change .
from the medical standpoint of view from the medical standpoint , you can say , my legs , the UNK UNK , UNK of titanium and artificial UNK , UNK UNK , UNK people , really UNK the way that they have their natural destiny , they 're not going to talk about the
so , perhaps this technological change is more clear , because the fact that there 's always a different truth , which is that every man of the society can be something very UNK and very powerful , and that human ability to adapt , is to adapt , our biggest plus .
so the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people are always asking me to tell me about how to work with intent , and i 'm going to tell you a little bit : this sentence never had to be UNK , and i 've always felt very uncomfortable with the questions of people , and i
this sentence by changing the idea of changing the idea that success or happiness depends on to be a challenge , not to be defined by the experience of the experience , as if my life could be so successful , because i could be so successful , because i could
but the truth is that we change us . of course we 're about the challenge , whether it 's physically , emotionally or even two .
and i want to say that this is good .
opportunities are not an obstacle that we need to do to come up with our lives better .
unexpected belong are just in our lives .
and i tend to begin to see stereotypes than my shadows .
sometimes i realize that he 's very present , sometimes he 's hardly to see , but he 's always with me .
and i do n't want to have the impact and the hard one of the UNK of a human being .
there 's immense amounts of life in life , and the challenges , and those are just UNK real and every person goes differently . but the question is not , if we 're not going to be clear , it 's not , but how we 're going to get it right .
so we 're not just responsible for the people that we love to keep in UNK , but they also prepared to get good with that .
and we do n't want to give our kids a good , if we give you the sense of that they ca n't adapt .
you have to abandon two things : to be a medical fact , being an example , and to the other , the social opinion that i 'm not disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real world 's actual disability , with which i had to put apart from me , is that the world is constantly , and you can describe me with these definitions .
in our desire , to protect the people who are on the heart , and the cool , hard truth about their medical prediction , or even a prediction for the quality of the medical prediction , we 're going to have to notice that we 're not going to have the people who are actually
maybe this is a recent idea , which is just what 's going on in a broken way , which is in an ever-increasing rate , and how to fix it , for every one of each one more than a bigger population is than the UNK .
if we do n't treat a human being , not all of all of its forces and opportunities , and acknowledge , we create , in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to lead , another disease .
we UNK a people who has value for our society .
so we need to look out the UNK , and focus on all of the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it 's between the perception of our fortunes and our great UNK , there 's a connection .
we should n't have to do this fun of time , or deny , we should n't try and avoid them , we should go to them under the carpet , but it 's about seeing the odds of the opportunities .
it may be more likely to say , clear that we do n't necessarily have to overcome improbable , but that we 're open , you 're going to have a hug , to put it on the UNK , and maybe even dance with it .
and maybe we 're going to make it more than a natural natural , robust and useful to see and feel that through the presence of the presence of no longer .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 percent birthday of charles darwin and when he had written about 150 years ago about evolution , darwin , in my eyes , in something very true in the human nature .
i would like this : not the most powerful of his way survive , and not the UNK of his way , but who can adapt changes best .
in conflict , creativity is created .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the ability of people to survive and survive , from the struggle of human mind , is to turn themselves through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the great skills of the human .
and maybe we just know what wood we 're going to do when we 're really going to go through .
perhaps that 's the sense of channelrhodopsin , a sense of UNK , a sense of your own power .
we can give ourselves a little bit about that .
we can give dissent a new meaning that goes beyond very difficult times .
maybe we can think about channelrhodopsin as change .
odds are , for a change that we have n't yet adapted .
i think the biggest of any damage we 've been doing to believe is that we should be normal .
all right -- who 's normal ?
there is n't a normal .
there 's the usual case . the typical one . but not the normal normal , and would you really learn this poor , gray person really want to know if you really had ?
i do n't think so .
it would be great if we had this paradigm of normal to the normal , or the strength , to make it even a little bit dangerous to work , to exchange , and so we can release the forces of very many kids , and they invite you to help their very special and valuable skills in society .
UNK have found that we 've always had people from the members of our society , and they 've been a chance of trying to afford a contribution .
there 's evidence that the neanderthals , before the 60,000 years ago , was older people and people with severe physical injuries with worn and could have been done that , because the life expectancy of the UNK of these people was valuable .
they have n't looked at these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went in the city , where i grew up , in a UNK in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there in front of a UNK tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had UNK .
and i hear a guy behind me , `` well , if this is not UNK UNK . ''
and i turn around and see this older man . i did n't know who he is .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , do n't we know ? i ca n't remember you . ''
and he said , `` well , you ca n't remember me .
when i first saw her , i was UNK her belly . ''
oh , the one .
and of course , it did do it click .
this was dr. UNK , a man that i only knew from narratives of my mother 's day , because i was , of course , by my birthday , two weeks later .
the doctor 's doctor , for my mother , was in holidays , and my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without UNK , and my feet had been UNK , and i just had some toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he was the UNK , that stranger had to UNK the bad news .
and he said to me , `` i had to say , `` i had to say your parents , you never had to walk , and never would be as profitable as you would be , like other kids , or that you never could lead to a UNK life , and have just been UNK . ''
so what i discovered was that he was collecting my entire childhood , no matter whether i had won a UNK in the second grade , whether i was in the second grade , whether i had a fellowship , or one of my UNK UNK UNK , and he used these clips to teach his students ,
and he called this part of his UNK , the x factor , the potential of human beings .
you ca n't just stress the way that this factor for the quality of people can be .
and dr. UNK told , he said , `` i 've learned that kids , if they were n't told you anything else , and even if they 'll just get a little bit of them , when you get kids to themselves , kids can achieve very much . ''
look , dr. UNK has changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis was diagnosis , and how someone else with it , are two different things .
and also , i 've experienced my thinking over the course of time when she had asked me about 15 years at the age of 15 , if i had taken my prostheses to meat and bone , i would n't have a second .
i was trying to do normal now .
if you ask me today , i 'm not so sure .
and this is happening because i 've experienced something with my legs and not despite all the experiences .
and perhaps that change could happen , because i 've experienced so many people that have opened my doors , rather than to meet people who made me , or to meet me .
look , it really needs to have a man who can show you how to UNK their forces , and they 're through .
if you allow someone to activate your own inner forces , -- the human spirit is so UNK -- if you create this , and for somebody in a critical moment you have to open up a door , you 're a very good teacher .
they 'll give you the doors to open up the doors .
the real meaning of the word `` UNK '' is in the word `` UNK . ''
it means to create something that is in one , the potential for UNK .
again , what potential is we going to do ?
in the '60s , in the u.k. , in the u.k. had a UNK UNK in the u.k. , UNK became transformed into UNK .
they call this `` UNK UNK in the united states , '' the `` UNK . ''
the students are UNK .
and the a student UNK UNK UNK , get the better teachers , and so on .
they then have a UNK UNK of people with a UNK , UNK UNK , and they told you , they were told they were very smart , and after these three months , they really had UNK .
and , of course , it 's UNK to hear a heart that the other writer was told in the other day , was that it was only enough .
and in the same way , it was also after three months .
but only those who were still in school -- apart from the students who had UNK school .
the key part in this study was that the teachers were n't UNK .
the teachers did n't know something changed .
they 've been told that the student and that are the student , and they 're the student with the grade , and they also have to do something with them and treated them .
the only real disability is a constant mind , which was broken , no hope has no hope . he does n't find any good . he 's missing our natural , UNK curiosity . and our innate ability of the imagination .
but if we create the human spirit to support the human spirit , to hope to hope and find themselves and other people around us to find beautiful , curious and UNK , we then put our forces in really positive .
when a mind has these qualities , we can create new reality and new UNK .
i 'd like to end with a poem that was driven by a UNK poet , called UNK in the 14 year-old , and the poem says , `` the god who knows only four words . '' `` every child knows , not the god of the UNK , '' but the god who 's only
come on , dance with me . thank you .
