yes , my day , my gentlemen .
thank you for the coming here today .
and i have to imagine myself now .
and my name is joseph shepherd , and i 'm confident , you know , `` welcome in the city .
that 's what we call a paper program for eight years .
and my favorite favorite is : first of all , second , second organization , is the public order .
so i 'm for the company of this city .
and so you do n't .
i know .
and beyond that , and this is something like my son especially , i am also .
that 's what i 'm asking the director of tea fire .
and sue 's dance and she 's got hungry .
and what i 've been thinking about is , of course , is an issue that i want to make it today .
which is the theme of the day , because this is what 's going on for fire .
we hope for the best and our team on the worst , that 's called a letter .
you know him .
he was indeed , really , in general .
and then i do n't start to say something that is so important .
i 'm going to do it a way .
so let 's talk about if there 's a risk that we 're going to come to just a decade for a disaster , for example , a designer .
a lot of people are on .
it turns out , it turned out .
and somewhere on the side , there 's a nest , dead , you 're going to leave something like that .
nobody seems to be there .
i do n't know that .
all of a sudden .
leave that .
police go , dance , toilet .
people are calling .
morton bast .
go out .
what 's going on ? questions , questions .
we do n't know , or we ca n't tell it .
people are leaving the building .
children cry .
maybe some of you may even think it has to go .
all of a sudden .
there 's open inside .
it 's a panic .
i 'm going right now here .
this is the rest of their imagination .
but it 's not something that i 've chosen .
that 's exactly what happened in this week .
there 's one such thing that 's left .
and it turns out that only , in stockholm , nine pounds of drugs were in it .
but people were just like that , and so , a friend of mine told me to come out of the building .
it was n't going to be there .
and it happened to be that suddenly , at least in the group that my friend was in my friend .
now , god is n't kidding , you know , otherwise it would n't seem like a whole lot of failure .
you can see , in a crisis , a very challenging disaster , is a very important thing .
communication is important important because people in this situation are just looking for communication .
you want to know what 's going on .
in the good time , the only time it was pretty simple .
we just did n't have either said or we have hungry .
why ?
because that 's what we call it was .
you know , you have to say , `` god , '' that people will go and panic , '' because we 're not going to do the truth or we 're going to tell us the cup .
this is in a era of social media , in a period of time , in a period of facebook , in a period of private and public services , at a time and public tv television .
it 's simple and humility because it 's just not moral and second , we 're going to be doing the last as a war that 's the event .
you may remember even going to the dump in the winter , which is a few times ago .
the first thing about this came up with twitter .
from someone who 's on a party , and they 're simple , and they 're working on , right , right , we call an airplane , and we save people .
this was not an insult .
you can see , we 're focused on this technology , and it 's easy to tell the truth of truth and to say very unusual .
because most of the last , we are , of course , is the last thing that 's going to know about the truth , because we need to be a nuclear state of what we 're just doing sharing information .
but that 's public media , or private media do n't mean so much , or they do n't .
so , we 're going to eat in food , and that 's the only thing that has ever been through the media , we think we 're going to deal in the future .
and we 're going to go to the good age of old .
but just as a form of power .
that 's what we 're going to do about a hundred of these hundred units in the building , which are some of you know about this , when it 's just a competition .
it used to be with it .
you may know , maybe you know what else 's going to do , just a minute , once and once soon .
i do n't know .
we 're going to come out today with all of this today , which is what we have in this place , which is about facebook , over facebook , over twitter , talking about television and all the internet , and the local media and so on , and there 's still with
and we know , we need to work very quickly , and we know it very quickly , and we need to work very quickly in particular , because the citizens and the citizens are ,
and we do n't even know what we 're going to say .
now , in the crisis of crisis , or at the end of the crisis , we have a question of going on all of the media that have been available to us , and it 's also a question of being used .
so , the problem is our biggest problem , because the citizens and citizens say , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , do n't all , or they say , it 's actually much worse than it is actually
we have a good experience about facebook and twitter , just recently .
now , again , you may have some of the media at all of you .
we 've had a big load of food in food .
and this was a so-called chemical machine .
these are bombs that are built with a board because they are n't going to have the first place on the sidewalk , but through the homes of the world war ii and only at the ground for a chemical reaction , which is
the problem is only a lot of these books have never been done and they 're like in the fall in food .
and there we were from an older gentleman who was going to be as good in the back of her , and that 's what we 've had to do now , he had seen as she 'd like this , and now he 's now , he
and by the way , a couple of young bush come in front of us .
we 'll see what we find .
and you 've got to look at this time , not going to be detected .
and so what we do is we do n't have park in the national park and we feel like the word in a particular sense of the word , which is called a bomb .
and in the history of the city , all the city begins to be talking about facebook and twitter , and with the result , that all of the sudden the total have gone to be a little bit more popular
and the media were really excited . they were in the background .
we did n't have to do with them , but they 've got credit and open , and everything about them and twitter .
the whole thing had a great effect for us , because the price of it is going to spread on these social media .
so simple , you have to give me a sign if i stop .
i ca n't look at the watch .
that 's because first of those social media , the advantage they have the advantage they 're very helpful .
it 's not that very popular because it 's got to get there or look at what you call it .
second , quickly , fast .
if anything is n't , that someone immediately immediately , so that the amount of which i just talked about , is going to be clear , because the whole community is essentially a little bit in the case .
and it 's very high , so if something wrong is wrong , then it can also get it very quickly .
and we have a huge announcement .
and i said , you know , the thought , like a bomb is going to look up in a cold park .
so we 've got all the things that happened in the last few years , and it 's a lot more than when you think a little bit of it than a consequence of you , as a little one .
again , the city of the city can get to look for every day of a year .
a nuclear bomb that 's going to go in in a park , certainly not one such thing .
but , you can also , and then we 're going , we 're just going to be found in the workforce , and then we 're going to be there with our heads and try to get it to seven feet .
and if you think about , you think about other cities , when you need to get it , you know , because you 've just taken a call that you have n't been able to do , then we already know a lot of
and that 's important to communicate , in one , because it 's just in a world that is now in a world that has to develop its speed of communication , to try to do something that people are capable of trying to make sure that people are able to
and the social media also help us to be connected , because they 're all involved in terms of communication , and it 's not just a name of them as we do it in the basement , and i certainly certainly worked in
now , today , today , is n't just an issue of law , not just a task of competition or the cat , the dance , the open red , but communication in the market and a catastrophe .
and it 's been shown that .
there 's over twitter and talking about facebook , a lot of the help , and when you were also part of that , you know , because all of these people wanted to be involved , and you did n't even know where
this shows there 's still a lot to do , but for the public communication , but that 's the same time that you 've done using the software and the whole thing you 've just shown that the social media is coming out of a factory
and i hope i 've got a little bit about that this medium , which is actually the case of the beautiful things that used to be used for the very beautiful things of life as a result of life , including its sense of purpose and purpose , and that 's what we 're as a city
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm a bit different .
i 'm a writer , and i 'm as you just heard it .
and i 'm now here now , to have a personal party .
what it is , that i 'm going to make it go out there , so i 'll also tell you that .
before i do that , i have to do some things .
the first one is , i think we really need stories to life .
we ca n't have the stories of stories .
and also , i think it 's very much more violent , violent , a lot of stories , when they 're actually becoming produced .
and i think that the internet , you know , it 's going to get very good in the way that you 're going to be really trying to open up .
and fourth , i 've been convinced , that people have been designed to be creative .
and they 're happier when they 're creative creative .
the more people are happy , the better we 're in the world .
it 's very useful .
now , this is a better world , but it 's just an epidemic .
in the first line , i 'm like , i said .
and the story that i 'm going to tell you is starting to get in a bar in which i 'm going to be happy to be happy .
that 's what 's called .
and it 's actually about 1,500 birthday .
now , you 're going to be able to do that , and i 'm not going to do that much with you , because in the moment that it has been completed , something that happened with you .
it happens in your mind , in your body , with your perception .
and she 's not really words for this .
you do n't know what 's going on .
i 've got words for that .
i call this the golden portrait of paper .
you 're looking at one of the page and you 're going to call it in and everything 's pretty black .
i feel like that i 'm kind of been quite cold .
sebastian .
and on the other hand , we 've got both pretty much color in the body of a lot of color .
and it was said that i 'm going to use a lot better and i write as i 'm wearing .
so , the first thing is happening now with your new perception of view , is a human man with dense hair , which is , she says she 's very serious , and he says , `` okay , your life is over .
that 's what 's called .
and what i call a very special type of thing about that , you know , you know , in a very particular way of people .
she was born as a coward .
some players are people who are in their age of family to do their own life .
who are familiar with you ?
very nice .
imagine if you do n't have the recipe in your neck , when you 're going to meet it , you 're going to get out of it .
so , you 're going , you 're going to run , you know , everything else .
what is really important , the players do n't have a look at themselves .
we do n't know when we die .
i wish i wish for every long life , but we do n't know .
it can be everything else .
and it 's hard for me to do so much .
you do n't know how much they can play .
that means that , every time it could be the last thing .
a player who has taken his entire creature , at the moment of the tower , like a duck .
now , you can ask yourself , if that 's so dangerous , if that 's so dangerous , why then they do ?
and the answer is quite clear : this .
without play , without a player around you , have , everything , and just when it 's a player , it 's actually alive .
they were born in the game .
so .
this is a story of diana , and how they now are the world of a player , and the first challenges that came in love in love , which is the story i want to tell .
and it 's in a form of a tablet .
the first thing has heard of thousands of consequences , sorry , and i 'm here to see here , i 've only seen it .
so , 12 issues at the first stage of five to seven minutes .
this type of resilience , one of the other things after one , is beautiful , you know that .
the television 's power has nothing different .
it 's not new .
and if it was all that if i was going to do it first .
and we do n't even do anything here .
now , it 's not right now .
let 's go back to back again .
what is the most famous letter of the movie or from the series ?
there can only one , right ?
thank you .
as if we had that .
and the thing that 's true is not too .
of course , there 's a whole lot of people .
so , there 's so many different games .
think of it , you 're going to be dancing , and you get them , you name , and so on and so forth .
and just like that , it 's the number of players .
and there 's a lot of stories that everyone wants to be told .
now , the next question is , who 's supposed to say that ?
i 've already won a pretty good opinion of myself .
i 'm going to be interested in incredibly intelligent and extreme creative .
but i know that a hundred brain is more than just one , even when it 's mine .
and so it came up to the idea that we have to change the difference in the creative process .
what if we did not just give us to cure or cure it , but actually it is ?
so if you say , we 're really going to give you very much that the development of this program is working with .
imagine for example , for example , in the front of three , a water record , you find , you know , because he looks for you about your grandfather .
and also , they 're a big fan of rock .
you can now be able to do now with the technology technology , which is n't quite as hard to make a shock .
and this store them on top of it , where it goes , and this is really cool , which is really interested in the real world .
that is , it 's not somewhere else , it 's right right there where it 's going to land .
that 's really beautiful that we 're on the internet .
and on the web , you can do everything .
so , every medium is somehow .
that is , you know , as a audience , you can write , draw , whatever you want to do .
and if we look at the same again , again , this structure .
this is a little bit from open web , right ?
this is what 's going to be built together .
and i 'm really struck about that the internet was born to tell exactly this sort of stories .
now , there 's certainly not that many , no one thing .
so , now , i 'm going to take a step further , and i 'm going to be the audience to the audience .
in a nutshell .
for example , you can go against characters like this , but also people in the real environment that also have this habitat on your cell phone .
so , you know , you know , you know , they 're all very well very good , they 're kind of like mobile nets , and they are incredibly productive .
these very beautiful areas , which are very rapidly .
and i ca n't go through that , because i would like 20 minutes or 20 minutes .
we 're going to come together .
every one is about three parts .
the first piece is this , and the second part is the canoe , and then we have that .
with this training , i could turn the master of the moment , and the only thing i need to do is : i do n't have innovation innovation .
they 've given me the first prize for the best .
and i have to say , these were taken from the banks of banks , of switzerland , and so on .
so , people hate , should , you should .
and if i can convince you , here with the internet , the internet is going to use the internet , you use , three-dimensional structures , by the way , i think i can actually convince everyone .
so .
everybody 's going to say , `` well , why is that all that ?
it 's because it 's already going to be all areas in this name .
well , we 've got the suggestion : who is , i 'm here , you 're in , every one .
of course , this is going to die .
in the series , it 's very much killed .
everybody 's going to say that everyone has to die .
and then , of course , every one is in the sense of everyone can be if he wants that .
that 's really important to me .
i come out of my head and there 's nothing more than me , when it 's going to be like this .
i do n't know if you know that .
if you 're in the theater , and you know , i 'm going to get in the room and you all like , oh god , please not .
and it 's not .
so it 's controlled interaction .
and nobody has to .
he can only be the audience .
the reason i 'm an economist is that the whole project is also going to be the same project .
that 's a couple of reasons .
i came to the project with this project , and i 've always been asked , and i 've been asked to -- do the whole thing in english , you know , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah
i can only tell you : the german age is the third of the world .
it 's the english , then the english and then the german .
so it 's not as if we 're in a little bit of more connected .
and i really think really really , really , really , in really really , when it 's other people as the other person as me that people are going to be grateful for something that has n't been taken by a number of being taken away , where the end of every
if it does everything like i would like to do this , i think the first step is going to be online .
and if you ask yourself why i 'm now here at a concert , where it 's under the right face of doing this guy in the face .
and i 've got a couple of thoughts .
i love singing .
not just run .
i 'm also very interested in love and dancing .
a few of them were in front of them .
and i can only say that this whole thing is incredibly important , and incredibly resilient .
but it does n't use anything if you do n't .
and my project is just a little thing that i just took , which i just learned about it .
and it 's called it .
and so far , it 's good .
i can only tell you .
so , if someone else thinks , i 've got to make this part of my life , i 've had a kind of an idea , and i feel like , `` i want to make a piece of music or whatever it is already now .
you can find on the internet .
on facebook .
great , just talking about it .
yes , i do n't .
and what 's hard to do is to ask memories ?
ask me .
can we memories memories ?
can you think about everything that 's going on in your life ?
have you still forgotten ?
who 's who can remember ?
there 's no hands up .
so , can we memories memories ?
apparently .
thank you very much .
no , we do n't want to do that .
and then the talk is quite short .
again , my evening , my name is samuel .
the talk here tonight i took myself because he 's two of my passions or my two big , right now .
i was doing all right here in front of college , and i 've been doing it with some of the trees , and the trees that 's going to be around the world today .
and now , at some time , i 'm also trying to do now as a police and a partner in private media .
so on the one hand , did i have to deal with the computer with computers , on the other side , on the other side , i am right now , right now , so how works that that 's human human ?
how do you change that ?
it 's a bit of a bit .
i was a very interesting discussion of artificial intelligence , with intelligence ,
so , the question was : when can we create a computer that works the way the human brain is ?
so , and i think we are pretty close to it .
so i think about two hundred years , longer does n't need that anymore .
but let me ask you why it does n't take a little bit .
so the interaction between the computer on one side and our brain on the other side .
so when we take the computer , then you have everything , you 've got your mouth , you 're running , you 're running , and you also see those cameras , and all the chinese apartments live on top of your little blood .
it 's called the ross , central dome .
these pieces are built out of small transistors .
now , the word has already heard everyone , and it 's always going to be called the horizon .
this is a little bit small device , which has three to do with each other , and it 's called electricity or not .
in our computer , in our field , i 've done it covers about five hundred million of these little parts .
and the game seems to break down .
we do things like , we do things like we do , we 've heard another talk about , you know , you know , can tell us , you know , can be able to hear your computer , you can do it very much , very quickly , but actually it can just zero
he ca n't .
it 's actually pretty stupid .
if we want to compare that to our brain .
our brain has been a little bit of the neuron , the body , and we 've got it , and we 've got it , a hundred billion , there is a hundred billion neurons in our gray charge here .
but the nice thing is , our neurons do n't just have three connections , but they have grown up to feed their bodies .
and that 's what 's called a whirlwind , just because it 's beautiful , it 's 10 trillion .
that 's 10 and 10 to thousands of rock .
so , since you see the complexity of our brain , much higher than what we 're right now as computers .
if you want to look at what it means , maybe you might see the one or the other ones , the first you who have ever been your own business , you get the ones , and the top of the ladder , and then , with the owner of the
but also , our ignorance also , sometimes , but the box has to cover about 65 watts .
and that 's what , and it 's the equivalent of two big bananas , so you do n't need it , and you have your computer up there .
now , if we 're going to make a good part of good part here up here , we 're going to open up with `` well , why do n't we remember why do we remember things ?
maybe it 's familiar with one or some of those things on the internet , like the human being only 10 percent of his brain , now you will now be this open to become your brand brain .
and it 's just an advertising .
ten percent , perhaps , but our brains is , yes , we 've got to our evolution on this mass of mass , which was pretty cheap , but in the middle of the middle of the middle , we 're still going to run our education into life , everything else has turned
it 's certainly not happen , because we do n't use it .
why is it that we 're going to get the biggest part of it ?
maybe you know the term of the multiverse ?
one of the things i 'm going to do is as beautiful as if you see in the ocean , in the middle of the sea , the top of the top is the top , it 's coming down , it 's going to come down .
and that 10 percent in the top , that 's the kind of thing that is our ability to our sense of our mind , but now , that 10 percent are going to run a big drop out of it .
now , we 're calling that statement , which we call a call , we do n't invent very slow , we 're making very cool pages .
and so , to take a look at that memory , maybe you know , or other people with your memory memory .
people who suddenly remember much more detail than i did n't have ever seen in the situation , and they would say , `` well , but already , but where do you know ?
that 's there , there 's a special thing called a particular , so someone with a man , someone who 's mostly on a field site , which is a little bit called a microphone , and he 's begun to run around .
and it 's not kind of like this , and it 's there , no , every single house , every single door , he has seen every single window , he 'd seen it back .
where is it that ?
so why is that , why we ca n't do that , well , that 's probably very close to know that the expansion has become a little bit more access to what it has to be a demographic percent .
now , we 're also using that , but why ca n't i remember the last night , all the details ?
now , tori made this interesting experience for me .
he was once an example at the university department and worked with a team that had their own best experience , that was n't more online , that 's actually used clean by the brain , that 's not something that 's gone .
wonderful , so , with that , it was very good .
but now , it 's about making people making their homes .
and it was in a very safe way of being able to be able to get this at the end of this event , but if you could n't remember more , then you could see the kind of flow of the car where these people were , not
and actually , in fact , we were born with this gentleman that 's one of the letters .
the second thing i really was amazing was , he had a lady in his room who told me that her mother had been her a little bit back in the journal when they were small , four years .
it was sitting on your mother 's seat and her mother .
and then , he said , `` well , in some of it , i do n't think about it .
and then they began to call it , which was four times as this , you could n't read , you could n't read , you can .
and then they said , he said , `` listen to me . ''
actually , indeed , you actually find looking at a section of gold in the himalayas , where it was right on this side of the text that was called the wife .
so the brain set up as much as she was as a picture .
and then she was able to read her .
so , yes , we 've actually got access to it , but we do seem like living in a normal life , we have to have -- we do n't have to have a kind of permanent technology to not have us .
now , now we do n't have the event of being , but as being said , he 's seen a picture of that , one , one , one , in our sense , so that 's what we see what we feel , and what we feel ,
and so , it was a little bit long evening , but then you 're going to be terrified , and you 're going to have a little bit , and i 'm going to ask you , just just step up just your eyes .
and remember a very , very exciting event in the previous past , yes .
take the first thing .
and if you do that , you 'll notice that they will be a visual part of it .
you might get an image , maybe even a movie ?
some people do n't think about it because we do that normal , but that 's what they do .
and if you see that , it can be you either in the movie , from your eyes , everything , or how you see yourself on one screen .
we call that one call us , the other one .
thank you very much , you can think about the thought of your eyes .
who 's got a visual information , right ?
yes , there 's a couple of hands up , that 's like , i 'm like , i 'm like , i 'm going to say , this is what i 've said , it 's actually something that we do n't even know .
well , let 's go ahead .
but also , what 's nice to be true about memories when they 're memories , not just that , memory , they 're high , they make sure that 's a positive event , and i 've got to see it , and i
and here 's what happened .
we 've done everything , well , the brain does n't make any difference between what we actually have , and what we 're going to imagine , what we 're doing .
so you can do this , when you go to home and look at something in the future , which is not something happened , you 'll get similar information as if you remember something that was in the past .
and , you know , these stories , which you 're kind of like , and you 're going to go into the ground , at the time .
back back , hey , there 's that , and it was so beautiful , and the longer those stories , the more beautiful things are mostly the stories , the stories , there was a lot higher .
if we do that in the process , so if we actually change the memory , why do n't we do that , i ask you ?
when i came here , my uncle saw me a picture of his head in switzerland .
a very beautiful picture , it 's also a very beautiful skull .
only , the picture is a little bit more beautiful than the kitchen , so it 's emotional liberty , he told me , `` there 's the house going to be done there . '' there 's a nice dog before , because the sun goes on the ground
and why do n't we do it with our own thoughts , our own memories , or hey , which is what makes me feel , because if i do that , if i do this , do what i 'm going to do ?
they really have an objective in their own mind .
do you know so some people who you see in the morning if they just have so precious eyes , what 's going on ?
i did n't have bad , i went all the way through his head .
i did n't know that whole night , and this idea did n't come to me .
i think it 's the other way he did n't get the idea .
the son , dear friend of mine , when he came to germany , because his mother was in israel , and he 's just kind of terrible .
what happened to do so , so he 's got every night with the son , and she said , `` do n't , what was the most beautiful thing ?
what was the most beautiful thing , and then he 's going to let him tell it , and he has just telling him what 's wrong today .
and , in about two weeks , that 's the son .
and then it was , ok , that the only way he 's gone back .
and the whole age of the whole age of life that is today 's one of the most people i know .
so it 's not the memories that affect us in what we are , but it 's our focus on what we think we 're using .
and how much energy we can use on it or use .
so , if you 're going to open up to your thoughts , or say , you know , this is now now -- that 's the thing that i do n't really have , but i do n't , you know , you 're going to be like you , you know , now
and what do we do , `` oh , '' ah , oh , yeah , there 's a beautiful , and that 's my head , '' `` what ? ''
and then take that time .
take that in your pocket and let it go .
or if you find someone , you 're sitting , you 're going to be fired your your boss , or your wife , or your husband , you laugh .
so , you take the picture , please make a picture .
if you 're going to run with you , if you 're going to have run with you in the background , you know , why do you laugh ?
because they 've chosen , because that 's a funny thing .
and they can much better deal with the situation .
so can anybody memories ?
no , i think that our brains have so much capacity to use it .
it does n't matter , because we can choose free , how much we focus , and how important , one memory , one thought it comes upon us .
so , when i 'm talking about you , you 're going to play with the pictures in your head , you 're using the power of your legacy and give him every day that your life is .
good afternoon .
thank you for coming .
if i 'm on a party , what i do so in my talk , and i tell you that i sit together with friends and i 'm wearing them to become a little stranger and i look at me in the head of my audience , and they
if i , then it turns out to be a `` the national for classical music , '' then you 're going to do these two hundred pictures of old people who are in just long , and very focused on art
and frank said , i said , talking about music to speak like architecture .
and so similarly , that 's the same thing that we do .
so i 'm going to show you a little bit about what i 'm going to talk about in a short movie .
morton bast
now , it 's a little bit of jazz open , right ?
that 's what makes it from my perspective on the point .
since now , what happens is taking the water out of the bible , they do something very different .
so we moved in such between homes and the middle , and the end of us were very early in our early experience , who had incredible power and pleasure with classical music .
but what we 've also known is that , of course , of course , of course , we 've got a little bit of joy , you know , a little bit .
and we are still aware that the idea of the traditional music is not to the content , so the music itself is , but at its own .
so let 's ask the question , how can we make a toothbrush that the music is close to the friends , the friends , and the fact that we feel like that .
how can we make an education that 's going on at the end of the ladder of the day ?
we 're putting the feedback that you know from the familiar , space , time , light , basically , basically .
so let 's take the relationship between liberals and musicians .
normally , there is between the stage and the client .
we 're going to try to pick up .
this is a picture of what we call .
the musicians are sitting in the audience , says they 're going to start to the most vulnerable , stand on , play , play , play , two pieces , sit in the audience .
the whole thing is going to be a little bit in the day .
everybody who 's going to come up and goes back to the stage .
or that 's in the office .
in the traditional northwest , it 's so much more comfortable in more or less comfortable , or so much as it is here , and look at the front looking at night and listening .
but there 's music , there 's actually no way you 're sitting sitting in .
and we 've thought , how can we do this .
if you live differently and you can buy a water piece of music , you 'll hear it differently .
here 's what we did when we did n't have a stage in this office room , four degrees for the audience .
the audience could n't afford .
and so i sat on the night one in the front row .
what 's important for us is that we do n't just make any language , but we think of the music .
so we 're going to ask ourselves , both what are going to do , but also in the minds of the people , the music does the music that they can do as well as they should ?
and so then , at night at night , you know , at the morning , you know , we do n't know , you 're going to be run by going to be treated in stockholm , you 're going to be in tokyo , in tokyo , in old
but not just the spaces , and then the lights can come to music and work , but also the connection with others .
and so , we 're totally happy that we 've done a couple of years ago , which is associated with us for ourselves , or movement like to music that really did n't have been a music .
and so then , for example , for example , from flickr , for example , from steve dollars .
and in this year , we have one , if you 're going to be like that ,
we 've done a paper video that 's done with a toy .
we 've talked about the story of the soldiers of steel steel with beijing , missouri , and we 've turned up to a piece of tape .
and it 's mostly because we 've had a big factory that 's in this piece of it .
we 've talked about a nuclear lot of money from people from all germany , so we could do that .
in fact , this is something called a community out of a community .
we 're totally happy to be born in a row in town that 's a hospital in town .
the city is so large that we 're going to make good spaces and places places for art , but also so small that we 're missing .
at the beginning of the year , two weeks ago , you 've been looking out of europe in the city , and then the simple thing in the city , more than having more people doing it than usually , as well .
the whole thing is going to be created .
we 're wired by an open-source mixture of students and students , musicians , snakes , snakes , really entirely entirely .
and in order to make a joint of a nurse , which is what they call and lead to food and training in the eye , at the seven to 10 to 10 inches in a dish that would take care for a year .
but also , you know , but you 've been doing it for a year , that , for instance , that means for instance , or you 're going to be the open , you know , are going to be safe in places , and you 've got to the company .
we do that in our lives and lives in germany in germany .
that means that most of the biggest part of this work is and at a stage .
only three times a year ago , we were running over the year to a ministry of research , research , just one of the other problems that you 've seen , and also open the system with each other , which is just relevant , if you want
and then , in the end of the day , we have been going to have to see 20 to four volunteers for a couple of days , or a couple of weeks , their hands , and where you can send it to where they 're needed , when they
and of course , in these 31 days , they were going to come to school .
now , you could do that , so , you know , well , you 'd have anything that you would like to do for a cat .
but our education still continues .
we 've done in the town of a large community around us around the city , which will allow us what we want to do .
this is from the traditional rush , but it 's also about the very practical things like this , for example , for example , that 's what we 've done with bread , or a bow that 's available to us .
it 's being taken in a garage in the town for which year and over .
to go to the camp .
we have found a whole bunch of individuals that can allow us to their lives so that can inspire the musicians .
and in this way , this is something that has become something about this city , and of people in this city .
they identify in a very special way with this .
since the beginning of the year , we 've been able to give up free support of the citizens in front of the world , which now is now the whole thing on a social cell and a little city .
we owe from the historical faith that classical music is far , where she comes in love hands .
that 's why we 're incredibly happy about that in the world 's young music music in their own hand , and at home in the cities , they 're doing .
if you 're still able to imagine that right now , the way that feels like classical music , then they 'll just move over .
at the beginning , next year we 're back to our camp , and we would be happy , if you 're there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you might think about it .
you know , you 've got to learn to learn about , or to the effect of learning , but i mean , you know , i want to learn to you , you know , that 's a little bit more accurate , and that 's what makes you wear
you know , you know , a beautiful joke for the ipad .
what i learned from art and culture , well , i think i 'm going to have a lot to say , because now i 've made this field in art .
and so i 've been thinking that maybe it might be true to make this something called a very different event of what my talk is .
art is beautiful , but it 's a lot of work .
you also have a laugh .
you always hear the laughter , although most of you know .
why is that ?
i think it has to do with that in the word as well as a word , which we do n't really understand .
art , we say , sometimes , that 's what .
we 're going to say this , which is what .
sometimes too .
the people who likes to work , that 's what i do .
but if we 're going to think more about that , and you think about the art , and you 're going to think about the rich level of how we 're moving , our experiences , our experience , our own ideas .
and so , i have to do what i want to show you about three hours in about three hours , all of the speakers , with one you start to start doing it for simply simple .
it 's starting to inspiration , for the childhood , going to look for my youth , i 'm not going to tell all of you from my youth , i do n't worry about , i do n't want to worry about why i
the interaction for the first part of my life lives and eventually , five , actors .
now , of course , this is going to be able to have these pieces of mechanical 's structure .
they 're going to get up , and they get up and
you learn it in the first two years , three years old , if you start to form , and i 'm kind of a time .
and so with 10 , 11 , i took these little pieces of pieces on the piano , not far from here , at the home , at home .
these pieces of life are built by a rock .
it 's going to be a pause and the other voice , but it 's very different .
it 's a bit in the same , but it 's actually turned off .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something that is going to be working , and if there are two voices , you start building together , whether it 's the present , the future , the past , the past , the past , the
and i 've learned , two videos , sometimes even three three , at the same time , at the same time , i 've learned to play a little bit of knowing that would have a voice , the other one .
that was what i 've learned about .
another experience , i 've never forgotten , and i 've got to worry about it , maybe i could go to it .
and i was japanese , and there was more people in the room today , and in the middle of the interview i came out .
i had forgotten .
i played played .
so again , and the same thing i did n't know , i did n't see again .
the audience has grown more than me , because i left on all of my room to my place , i got my notes , and put it back and started the third one .
and they do n't believe like that at me .
but it was a very powerful experience .
maybe it was also one of the experiences where i knew , you know , well , even though i had fast fast , i 'm not going to go to my life , because if you talk to talk about it .
yes , the next chapter i 've been doing with a lot of music , and i also want to tell you stories .
so when i was that , i went to my shop and i told him , i told him , i 'd like to play a banjo .
and he said , `` well , that 's not . ''
there you have to be a lot of high school and have a lot of experience with women .
now imagine , if you look , if you 're a sick young guy , you know , young , just one sentence .
i do n't forget that .
and from that point , i 've been able to become more .
now , i was at the end of the way , and at the time i was going to be in
i 've come up and i remember a situation that i 've never experienced .
it 's been the head of steel 's king , and now i 'm coming to the part of it , i do n't have a position , and she was with the most beautiful position , the entire thing you had to do the poor , and then it was going back
now , i ca n't think it 's a lot of the time , but it 's not a house , and i could n't do it anymore .
i saw this firsthand 20 , 30 times a little bit , and suddenly it came right .
and then i played them on , and i fell in a panic , and i just knew i was suddenly on the ground and i was laughing .
i was there .
i did n't have anything , did n't take , and the music was doing this with me .
a experience of experience , where i 've learned , i 've learned to emotions .
and sometimes it 's also right to work that you have in this kind of formal , in this condition , i call it .
where everything is going to do .
and we had this situation in the situation , and then it 's in a state of an organization .
there it almost almost everything , when we made the balloon , it took only a long months where it would take a long time for it .
well , that 's my personal experiences with the piano , with me , working with work .
and now i 'm going to come to my minister , d.c .
i was at first as a college computer , but i used to do that .
we 've played skype , and we 've got dancing .
and i 've been given , and i 've been able to do this for my fingers for the music to be able to be able to do that .
in the music , you know , you breathe , you 're wearing , wonderful experiences that i 'm very , very few .
and then , a point where i came up to be an expert in the theater theater , into the course of the year , and i was doing this with all of this kind of art , politics , because that came out because of this , or this thought came from
which is , in art , to make culture , to make my dream .
so here 's work for art , but not as an artist , but , you know , you do n't want to say that , but rather than to do business and do something .
i was there in theater , and i told myself , and there was n't a case for me just in my theater , just in philadelphia , and i 'm there , and i 've always been able to think about this question , what can you do to create the way for art that you can do
and that was the reason why i used to do in my lifetime , in the direction of that , and when i started , and at the age of a year , i was then .
but before it was another of other , and this phase , i did n't know with interaction .
and i came to school , and i did for german .
the german surgeon , his independence has been in .
i 'm also , although sometimes in my play , because i was born in prison , and i 'm always standing , and i said , `` i 've got to call it , '' i 've got to do it .
but i also have a new root because my family 's office were also turned out , and there , in philadelphia , i 've seen the koran .
this was a little bit of something i did n't think , and suddenly i was in a different form of culture , in a factory , in a culture , that lived in a culture that was lived in a culture of people in this particular device .
so as soon as we speak to us , we all live in a very different situation , in other circumstances .
and then i went to mit , and for the environment , and i worked , which was my friend and colleague , and that 's when we 're always doing for the last night music , he said , `` the other hand , '' ] , for instance , i could
we made it made , well , but of course , on the notes of the album , i stopped getting home .
and this one , it was really coming out of people .
it was my destiny that i traveled at home college and i did n't work with my mentor , and i did n't work with the wall .
i was eating on the next day , and i had this set of , oh , the wall is , yes , yes .
and i 'm waiting for waiting for any of those questions .
and what i was here for the cities in the '70s .
and since then , i 've been able to experience a way between two young cultures .
in fact , we 're talking about the same language , the music is going to be wonderful , and it was wonderful , but a lot of it was cold .
in other words , it was n't all about the people , but it was a lot of it , and that 's what i 've been looking as a big , sort of , like the german identity , that 's what the german identity is going to come back
but that means germany , yes .
since then , there 's a lot more open places .
but then i 've learned about all of the things that i 've learned before all of the city .
so , we 've seen from the board , which i did , by the way , a hotline , i think , when i came here here , i was actually here , and she was in my own business for culture and a lot of fun .
i have the one .
now , good news for you , you did n't want to write and practice .
i was actually the first of the ipad .
so , i do n't have so much that much , but anyway , that was a great thing i 've had to do this , but she soon soon , because i was then interested in education and that could be able to build education .
we 've done a lot of work for the prisons , we 've got that if you 're just going to take a look between , you see , see , and see what we 've been doing , and you 've got this , you know , where you can explore between
many , many , many , i could create , and i could build it and i 've been able to experience what that means when there are different kinds of different areas all the time .
by the way , by the way , i 've become more and more of the art of art , increasingly to culture , to us that , to us in the world between people , between cultures , between cultures , between communities , and i come back to
interaction was also the subject of the subject when we were , and then , seven had had the idea that at harvard university , who could now take care of 3,000 feet .
but this last chapter , this fifth one has the most famous response .
this word has two characters , for one , i 'm connected with something , so i can do it , and i can use it , and i can say , but as a verb , i say something that is , i know
and it 's always going into its fingertips .
i know what i 'm doing with this , so i say , i mean , you know , or the community .
and i made myself with something if i 'm wearing and i say that , i want to recognize that what i want to recognize .
and that 's a great deal .
five , three million people are trying to move , and have moved to sea , in the same way , to look down and to realize that a community is in europe .
so , as big , we 've called it called `` big , '' but , as a community of a community of a lot of people who live in a large range and very common language , and yet a common language , even when
with signs , at the head of the highway , a lot of other people .
so , one of the experience of the things have not so many people .
and then there 's actually a lot of food , and food , two schools , worked out , young girls , from the mit , and young student from a school school school , people have said of people , young men , made their girls from
and it has been a special effect that young girls wrote letters and young letters , and he said that of young men from germany in something called `` germany . ''
and this is where one of these young men got in front of the family and i used this album that i loved .
and he goes out of a letter and said , `` i 'm a blogger , he wrote it home as a young girl who he was playing , and i could never play a play , because my two fingers are just turned
and he put his finger with a bow , and he sat back to the piano in that piece of armor and tried to play the play .
and it did n't stop him .
it was kind of like for me in a game that i 'm going to be after , and i said , `` what do we actually learn ?
we 've learned that we 're spending a lot of people together , but all of the things that we 've learned is that we 've come to live in peace years in peace , and the culture of us so that we 're not going to
and that was a wonderful experience for me , and you can see it , it 's not just about being something .
it 's always learning learning to experience and to win .
and if we do a lot of design and invention , when we manage it , we 're going to tell us about art and culture , to transform our own location , in the conversation with the art , by working with the art , when we interact with
and i hope that they 'll have a lot of luxury , and they 've got it , and they do that they 're going to make this move .
thank you very much .
yeah , thank you .
i think we 'll wait for the first picture .
so , i 've got to clean up to the support of my eye , and i have a couple of slides .
but it 's not a scientific database , but it 's about my office here , and i 'm going to find a subject on that , where i think this will be the next few years .
now , in the most popular words , i know , thank you very much for what is going to be ted , and i think that in the area we 're going to be able to present this talk .
and then i have heard that in english you should be asking the talk in english , if somehow , when you look at it , you see , you would n't understand what i was going to say , i do n't know how to say
we 'll die .
i have to tell you about the first of your talk .
in the hospital i was patient in the hospital when i turned out to open and went off .
she was the first man who was in war , and it 's always like to play in the english , because she was the same thing in her husband , who was the first man who was in war then .
and so it 's every year for the first time , and it 's long , and it 's probably once you 're going to have a clean system too much , and then it 's going on now , and it 's got on the right side of this
a couple of years before , you 've also been able to go in and have the same way , and in the same way , with the same reason that left left leg .
and at the time , i was also there as a physician and i 've been able to know how they 've been working on in the workforce about how they 're being treated with drugs , as well as a physician , and began the discussion ,
does it make sense that in an old people like this crazy thing ?
so , you can go , you know , in the late days , is this a man at all ?
and it 's been grown .
five years later , i 'm going to go to the clinic , and i see the name , and i can tell you all that , because he 's just so rare , it 's time for the time , and it fell in love with the other leg .
so , the question is , what do i do when i talk about how a person should decide for what he wants to do in his own , or what he does to do ?
and so that 's a little bit of the subject of it .
you can see here , then we 're going to look at the scene of what we 're going to die .
it 's a book made from `` california , '' how we 're going to work in a report .
and then it was like that globalization was very powerful , so that you have asked , how do you go to work ?
you then , you know , you can still read this book in this book , as i said , there 's going to be a pyramid that 's going to be there , so the parts are always together .
it 's going to be a way of work , and it 's also going to be much more likely to be a lot harder for china , for example , that was a big issue .
and that 's what the work of one of the individual , of a kind of , something , has been increasingly , in fact , that it 's always been more effective way of the quality that he 's got around .
and that , in my view , that people have kept less vulnerable to their work , and they 've become more part of a small thing that has been able to achieve the first stage in high seas , and no more about his work .
and if we put that in the back and medical field , then there 's some of it .
if you 're on tv , you know , you 've heard about doctors and nurses , and you look at most of them , they 're called what we call them .
and that 's nothing else than that has got to be taken out what you 've done to do it , so it 's going to be paid for it , and if you 're not that it 's not , that 's the medical service , you do n't want to do this
and through these rides , it 's going to become more effective and more and more and more and more and more about this notion that you can use your work and use it from personal memory , into the background of such a
well , a good friend of mine came to me , because he did n't want to get this out of here , she had a medical practice , and he 's moved to a factory factory , and he 's turned to the city for a doctor to be
now , in the meantime , we 've been looking at this technology , and he 's got a little place , and he had the book , and it had just seen that there was more old people between the north , the hospital , the back and the back , because they do n't
then they come to the hospital , and they 're going to go back in the hospital , or we 're going to sleep and they will continue to continue .
and this was a little bit of thinking when there 's something like this , and then i want to let to come up there to something that you can use out of this cycle of bone and that you can also take a clean out of
now , in the middle of the summer , he also had to find the language , he had to learn the language of a hard learned , that he had exactly the same thing that happened in that dish .
it 's going to be increasingly used to die as well as a result .
it 's not that anymore that 's important , but you 're still in a dish , i want to say , for instance , or not in the hospital i 'm in the office .
and then it becomes the magic .
it 's like that , at the last few days , i 'll find a conversation with the number of people , and then you have to go in your hospital , or i do n't want to go to the hospital when i
so with that , i want to be honest , or i do n't want to go down .
this is the data then then go to a map , and there 's this doctor for you , and then you have the decision of decision on that .
now , if we 're going to go back and do n't come back , you 'd n't be able to get married , then if you like to have the second dance in may , you would have been able to go back in , and you imagine that at some point , you know , i 'm not going to be able to get you
and that includes me with my friend now , who is sitting there in the sun , and also a lot of a lot of time to deal with it .
in the last year , it 's like said that 's where you do n't know , until 27 percent of the people do n't go home , but in hospitals in hospitals , in hospitals , and you can also see that , not the ideal , for old people , but
there are very few things doing this very well , and there are very , very popular people that are there , but when i look at them , and we have about five times a year , so , about a
the whole thing is , of course , for sure , is clearly clear , all of these things , and this control is because it 's the money that 's going to be the money for a family of a family with one or two .
it 's just not the reality , but you do need two more of them in the jungle , and it 's mostly , and it 's just the size of it .
and it 's a battle of the control of the brain as a result of the fact that we grow , that you want to make it , it feels very likely to look at it .
and now , i 'm going to ask , you know , maybe you can , and so what we 're doing now in the last , because i ask you ask questions , you know , that 's not exactly the situation for not anymore .
and so , i just went through that , and i put this article in front of me , because i think that a society needs to be able to form and form these whole structures that we 've been doing all this to what happens in our society .
and in the book of the book , one of the people is , the dignity of people is .
and the second sentence is to protect them , and the second stage of all of them is doing .
and , for me , sometimes , there 's a third sentence out there that every single individual should have to do that , to protect it , to protect its dignity .
because this is a way to break itself from this case , i 'm going to give it to other other , and i want to have a sense of a lot of time and then , and then i do n't have to think about it as i
because in the last year , it 's the same if we do n't like to do this topic , we 're going to come back to the point .
hopefully , with a hundred or a bonus .
well , that of course , of course , i also want to say that i want everybody to do , and i want to do it , but eventually you 'll have to follow it , and if it might be so far , or even if you 're
now , if you think about it , what 's going to do is , then will you move to the dots , where then you 're in the last , what are the five things in my life ?
now , there 's a book which is a book , which is actually a book .
it 's the course of course , it 's the friends that i have , with which i can relate to , and i can help , who i know , and who made me through life , and they 're
it 's safe to trust between people that i might have to do with , in the middle of their own , or whether it 's a cup or a cup or a person or any other people that i have in relationship with .
and there are many of the individual factors that are there , and i 'm not going to go through that now .
but if you look at these three points , then you 've already had a whole lot of tasks , you know , in life , maybe you have to deal with your own dignity .
and then there 's another factor of what we 're seeing a little bit of the alphabet , and i 'm like this one as a text or as a text or as an example .
other people can make these decisions , and this behavior , what they do , not meet .
that 's my inner mind .
our dignity can only come out of us .
so it 's not the question , which is , what others do for me , who will me do for myself , or do n't care for me ?
but it 's just the way you can ask , where i can think of people , where i am able to be able to , and where i 'm going to be able to use my perspective , that i can deal with these questions , and i can go
and then , if you 're going to work , i 'm going to be this inside of these things that you 've seen from the outside , it 's an opportunity to say , i 'm going to get into my own self to this
because no man can tell me how to see myself because of what i want to look like .
and i do n't have to go to any research in general class or saying , saying , you 've got to do a plant now , and you know , because you 're so old , you know if you 're going to be
these questions , i can probably do those questions , in the last part , to long , probably , to make a long period .
this person 's dignity is an inner brain that is going to me and ca n't be able to be able to be able to be able to protect the state , so that the state ca n't protect , and can also bring to other people who i am for a human being .
and to talk about this , it 's going to make spaces , and i think , and i 've been doing this talk called this talk , and here 's two spaces , where a space space is like this in food , so that it may not be
so that , if we 're old , we can say , well , you know , that kind of dance in may like mine , even though i might be very high , that 's a time .
thank you for your attention .
nice evening .
i 'll do two things .
if you get the first part of it , your first will be a little bit more ...
it 's a second second .
let 's start with a little bit .
that 's ridiculous , not .
what do you mean ?
are there different ?
or is there enough enough ?
yes !
that 's not good if there 's one thing that looks like .
so , in fact , but i 'll leave you for those who know it .
we do n't .
we are only just with one only .
and i 'm going to start to say that a little bit about it .
we do n't know , we know , we 're able to know .
and it 's a little bit of what 's going on .
if we 're in the back of the brain , and we 'll pay two , for example , in which one for instance , in other people .
we know , well , suppose we look into the box , the number is small , it 's three , and it 's three people .
we can figure out if we 're in all the same number of elements ?
how would we do it ?
that is , we 're just going to get people down , one , two , three , we 're going to get the three , you know , three degrees , one , two , three , three and three three three three , a little bit
you know , yes ?
very nice .
it works in a good way , it works in big numbers , even though it 's got it .
but it will .
how can we possibly exist ?
how do you notice that there are so many people who are there ?
and i 've already mentioned , and people and not what else .
sebastian !
you 're called the driver .
you know , this is clear , not right now , that 's where we 're going on in the classroom , and we all know .
not that that 's very beautiful .
so , you 're looking at the same thing as well as well , and it does it work , right ?
you take one of you sit on a chair .
so next , the next thing , way , is the next thing , everything is going to do different people going different , and no chair is left , and they 're just big big , okay ?
now , let 's go through that .
how can we two little examples of each other together ?
we would say that one is about large or bigger or smaller than the other .
we could do it ?
we would start again again .
right , that 's wrong , because the point is , if you 've got a little long amount of stuff , you know , i just say , you do n't have any other .
it 's up , zero , etc , is it clear ?
so , how is it going ?
marcus ?
it 's done , smoke !
she had done that , right ?
hey !
so now , let 's look at that .
guess it 's always bad , right ?
you ca n't see , you do n't see , yeah ?
the point is , you just do it .
if i 'm going to use that , you take natural numbers , natural numbers , you know , we 're going to need the zero zero at the beginning , zero , one , two , three , five .
and we would have , let 's just take a copy of that , and let 's just take away from one of those examples , which of the amount of noise .
there are just numbers , okay , zero , two , six , six , six , period ?
okay ?
all right , there 's been on top of the smallest long list of the natural numbers , but on the one hand , are spreading out on the other , and you 're going on , okay ?
what we call is a lot of migration of the line , we call the other numbers of natural numbers .
what do you think ?
is it more powerful , is it bigger than bicycle , right ?
right ?
but that 's pretty scary , yeah , i do n't have a stick .
who is another chance ?
smaller ?
who 's got bigger ?
ah , that does n't really have any plan , right ?
it can not be , yes ?
you ca n't tell where what is missing , there 's nothing , that 's not going on , right ?
okay , they 're going to say smaller ?
you would expect , not ?
that 's what you say , is n't you fake .
and now , now , now , i 'm going to show why they 're a little bit .
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we mate .
that 's the point .
we mate .
we 're just going to take the zero from the far amount , we take a zero from the natural amount , we eat .
the next of zero , after two , two , after the zero comes to zero is one , and i 'm going to get it back .
the four , the two , the six , the eight , the eight , yes ?
you can do it , and then it 's going to happen , it 's clear , right ?
and it 's totally clear , by the way , what i do is that i 'm always going to do it in the front of me like this .
and here 's one , because there 's just the line on it , and the painting is the same , right ?
we were pushing the natural space , and it 's actually coming out of it , and the band is always the same way .
that 's only one thing .
so if you 've got to know about what we 've learned today , you know , what 's the problem , i just know ?
there 's an infinite amount of property that do n't exist in the background , and this is the quality of it , that 's absolute , there 's a really , really , kind of , really , really big , that is exactly that size .
they do n't do that in the workplace , when they come out three three of people , and then there 's just one one there , and there were three .
yes , so we 've done that .
is n't you ?
okay .
we 're going to make a second part of it .
the professionals , the lack of us .
here 's what i 'm doing .
in this experiment , i 'm sure , is going to be a third of the third , and is it someone who has it on it , right ?
so , let 's call it the door , b , c .
i have behind my life , i hope you 've never heard .
and you want to guess now .
where , you know , i 've got something else behind a , b or c ?
well , guess , this is our , here .
you know , you know , c .
who has another idea ?
a one ?
who has an idea ?
it 's like , you know , b , b has n't , is n't you never hear it , is it ?
that 's right .
it does n't matter very much , so you do n't need to have my name , and i 'm looking for myself .
it does n't matter , right ?
it 's very clear , because that 's the chance that you have enough happiness , you know , it 's only a third .
well , there are three things , it does n't matter , yes ?
now , i 'm going to do this , i just do it .
well , i know where it is .
now , she 's up here .
so , i know where it is , and the reason is , and the idea is , whatever you call it , go to a second round .
so i 'm now really now now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now i 'm
so it 's like we go into a second bar .
now , imagine , i 'm looking at this a , you know ?
so , now , i have to show you a video clip , which is n't you and you 're not told .
because , if you 're b b , and i say , and i know yes , it 's not on b .
then there would be no second .
then i say , `` well , from the mouse , i 'm afraid .
but i do n't know , this is a saturday thing , going to go to the second round .
so , can i just have a box behind it , not only is it , but what they do n't have said .
now , the question is , and that 's the probability probability , because of the condition here , under the condition that 's open open , and it 's not in its last opportunity , you 've got your last chance ,
now , it 's not going to stay in a second , i 'm going to make a look .
so i 'm going to do what you want .
or you say , i 'm doing c .
now , the prison is now , now , is it possible to become more likely ?
well , it 's really nice , b 's up , and now i know it 's up .
or , thank god , that 's been open , i always wanted to go to a heart , that 's it .
or if you 're going to say , you know , you 've got up , we 've got , you know , we 've got two doors now , now it 's safe to change or stay .
what do you mean ?
it does n't matter .
sebastian .
why is n't it ?
very nice .
why is it it ?
yeah , that 's wrong .
now , that 's pretty much as if we saw it yesterday , in the face ?
but they are , in a new way , there 's a new one , fun .
so , you know , the thing you 're really , yes .
that 's all of us , i do n't know , six , yeah , yeah , i do n't have a good age , but i wo n't be able to be able to show you ?
so , it really really everybody .
behind this door , it 's a third third .
and it 's only a third behind the door .
you can guess what you want , you 've got two percent of them , you 're in the supermarket .
that would have you can think about two people , not you can do it at your time , you can do it on two dozen , it 's yes , if you cut the zero , you 're in real life .
but here we have one door .
so , it 's like , two thirds is not what you think .
so this is the two third here , but it 's just behind one door .
behind that , it 's not .
so , what about more ?
in fact , i was really lying .
so , what 's more more likely ?
it 's better , it 's better , right ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yeah , sure !
so , it was n't hard , right ?
ha !
what do we see ?
you 've got fun .
why ?
very simple , well , two percent are not a hundred percent : the difference between theory and practice .
i hope it was for every time .
thank you very much .
chris , for me , when she was preparing me for a year artist and eat food and dying food , and people people had come up and a half of a sudden he has been completely completely .
but i do n't know , my best mind that this is all over the way of being these things .
i mean , you know , you know , and i knew until i was n't really depressed .
that 's what it 's been for .
yeah .
thank you so much for coming today .
i grew up here in near .
and i do n't know if it was a very good time to ask myself , whether i want to talk to ted on ted , and i do want to talk to you about a particular topic .
i 've chosen my pants , and i 've got trust .
yes , motivation is n't bad , and i 'm calling the woman at night , who said , maybe he 's making a or more expensive one .
i 've also got full of it .
so now i have to go to the north pole now , if i 'm going to do it well , if i 've got to get a little morning , i 'm going to try for three weeks , because i was going to go back in three weeks
and before me , at the end of the day , i did n't turn the training training .
so , if you want to go , you go to go back in morning , tomorrow 's going on , you know , i 'll make you all .
i 've been told about , in short , i 've lost a lot about this issue .
and i 've started , and i 've started doing it , and i 've been doing it .
do n't worry , you know , the nice little , a little bit of body , a guy comes up .
i 've got a lot of thought before it , when i 'm a writer , what do i do when i 'm doing ?
so , i come from going to village with six houses in six , many of them , some of them , and my parents on the water is apple , and they are , and what 's power for us .
trust , in sports , of course , not in my own office room , it 's like , `` and beer . ''
why do i know the story where i come from ?
for me , one of the most important stories i really was really about from the country , from the village and there was with two great brothers , with the oldest brother , who 's up .
and with the second brother , the same way to blind is like me .
so , that 's looking at the light and dark , which can be like me , where basically windows in the room , whether it 's light on space , whether it 's light at it .
what 's really happening today is now for that .
the way , or we can see both of the time before us .
`` i 'm going to sleep , but i can tell you that i ca n't tell you , this is a black man .
it 's the theme of the old men , the way .
it 's going to go to places .
and what i 'm always interested in was the fact that , of course , is actually the fact that you trust trust and you 'll have in that big trust , that 's that we all need to make a little situation as a little situation .
and it was for my parents , that she was like many of you like many of you before my brother and i did n't have any blind ever .
we were so the first ones that are relatively suddenly in their life .
and then they had to do something from the situation .
and , now , i 'm sorry , it 's a great happiness that my parents do n't have spent the last day to stand next to us and make us on the hand , or say , there 's a wall wall , and then you can feel where you
well , a guy would have been like -- we 're home for home .
and b is taking our parents from the beginning to focus on the road , where our baby brother is .
so , in the house of the day , the wheelchair stops , and it 's even risk .
since there 's the guy brother at me with a high place of a cold high school company .
so , the dynamics that i 've got to today is still .
so that 's the great brothers -- they 're not just the good ones for the police but also for them .
and then our brothers and my brothers and i went on and i went out on a hot hole on what could do everything they could do , especially for instance .
and that 's how we 've got to take the barefoot brother with three and a half years ago , and then we wanted to go -- michael and i .
and then they began to travel , like used to drive a lot of small kids , and today they 're doing now .
until this is what it means .
but we 've done this again , at some time .
and then the big question : how is it going to go ?
and how do you trust that , that 's the trust of the parent that the children will have gone back to the house and have to become free and on the side of us that we do n't go to fight .
and our solution was that , of course , we do n't have a sense of our parents to tell where we are , where if you have a car where you might have , you know , there 's any kind of other thing going on , you know ,
and we had to look at ourselves , and we had to see it at the end of the moment , but the subject would be .
and this is n't what you can see here today , because otherwise it 's going to be so loud that you do n't have any more of it .
but if you 're in the evening , if you look at it , and you 're in your bedroom , or in the front of it , you 're always going to be surprised .
you can try to try and just get rid of contact with your tongue , and you 're going to be able to find that in a way of humans as well , you 're going to hear a human .
so , like the bats , they will hear , right now , be open open wall because the sound is different different .
and that 's true for me to trust , so trust in the movement , always has been important .
but in addition to high have high practices , and the security is , i have a good chance to help me .
and i do n't speak to speak without a lot , and i 'm sure , even without many , you know , one or another , of course .
but what i 'm sadly today is n't the pictures that i 'm very privileged , who is one of our partners as children .
and that was the equivalent of our growing buildings on this planet .
i 've heard about this : it 's called a distributed diversity .
and that 's what i 've already looked very , because i do n't know as a person who 's a little bit later in the middle of the interview , and when i 'm talking to trust , and when i 'm preparing to trust , on the scientific page , i 'm never seen as a
i 've never seen that as well as well as .
but also , i 'm sure to do with that , of course , that it ca n't happen to anyone in the real experience .
diversity is the way of our power to the problem , at some point , where i am doing well , what do i do , and where do i really know my entire life is really full ?
and our brother just came back , and i kept walking on the house .
so , it said , okay , we 're going up here .
you can go somewhere out of a window window from a cliff for instance .
and the experimenter then went around , michael said , and i 've probably heard every little bit of the time in front of you and the girl , i do n't know .
but finally , who got to go down ?
so i do n't .
and i feel like that , we 're the generation of young women here , not .
and so , i 'm still doing that .
and then the result was that at some point , we did all three of them going up in the top , and the baby was filled with a bunch of other guns , and no longer knew what to do that .
because no , of course , when others think about it .
so , if the father said , you know , for god , help help , help , i do n't -- somehow , you know .
it 's never happened .
he had to always always look like this , because he was still slowly slowly for us , and he had to say , which has been given us .
and i found that for me , for me , that we had this opportunity .
but sure , no worry , this is not an accident , not to make up later .
so , for me , the different brain that lives in my life are always important , everybody , interesting .
and most of all , they were all for this , because i could have been able to see : where i 've been , i mean , my borders , which is perhaps such my favorite .
you 've never been too good for me .
and that 's why i did n't have the pizza .
and i do n't like to go to this day .
i 'm going to run out to that today .
now , it 's not at five degrees like now .
and when it 's used to clean rain , but it 's still going to be inside .
but i 've always been so trust for me so that trust me in my own sense that i have different physical .
for example , the first time they were .
and that was pretty beautiful because there was the phone who had ever been in the room , and i said , ok , we 've done a lot of kids ' kids , but they 're sending us
in fact , it 's good , because there 's only one person at all .
and then you see what the other power is .
and there was always one of my big trust , and of course , of course , if i 'm going to go through a long time long , because then i can think of maybe what i do n't have .
so there 's only one way , and that 's the trust of trust .
the other one is a foot in the back of myself , and let me go down , and then he 's back to the back , and it 's all over , because that 's the full
i 'm not trying to do this .
but i had to think about it myself .
so , i think that 's now a little bit of a lot of time .
and that would i have no volunteers here , right ?
in fact .
`` oops , i 've won .
okay .
the next thing for me was critical , as a pilot in school , then my brother and i broke up .
my parents were at home , or they 're up to today , and they 're taught us as children .
but for me , i was also important to school , but how can i do it for a lot of school in school ?
and then , i was able to make a sense of school at school .
and even though , i was always thinking about this , that 's all of those things are boring , because you 're going to do things like this , i do n't know what i 'm doing .
i found out -- `` i do n't know today .
and i said , well , i 'll do with my neck .
and then , you know , well , you know , human beings , again , this is the big diversity in the sports , because you need to use , you need power , you need a force , you need a force , you need
do n't -- you know , you 've got a lot out of your work out of your work ?
that 's what it 's like in a coma .
you 're going to quickly quickly , if you have the full of trust in your own technology .
if you have that trust in your own power -- the force you know that you are all the time to any conditions in the same place as bad weather , when you can see , you can see , for the rock rock , you can see the amount of
and if you have a case , you 've got to trust in the team .
it 's because of a woman that 's nothing , but i 'm obviously not fully open .
and i 've never seen something like this today -- i need to use the word -- my sister -- there 's only one -- just recently , has made my practice done today .
but no , we 're going to do it again again .
but i 'm afraid i 'm going to show it now .
in one with one one , one of them , one of them is another practice .
so , what i 'm always doing is that i do n't know what i know about , this is the practice that i 'm going to pick up the audience as it is that if you do n't do anything to make you very own , and you 're going to run a little open .
so , if you 're an anthropologist , you have two channels in your hand .
so , yeah , yeah , i do n't have any hand anymore , otherwise , otherwise , i could have my name up , and i 'm wearing the same .
do n't .
so i have to help myself differently .
so i went up with what i was doing .
and it tells me the voice .
so the only thing has to do is , you know , that 's always what
and this is important for trust .
the implications of communication , of course .
and the shepherd 's always say , when it comes to the left , i 'm going to say , and he says , `` on 11 11 , i know it 's easy to left , so at the top of it , you know , you know , so on the left
if he says , `` on the left on 10 , there is a little bit to the left , and if it says , you know , on 10 .
okay , everybody understood ?
and then watson 's a problem , because then i have to go back and see me again , i do n't know what it is .
and for me , it 's very big , critical when i 'm going to go through this , and i really have to really fully down into that completely , and i have to say that i think really completely .
to say , he 's the tools for me to use the tools that i think are really going to be very quickly , and it 's also growing up faster than others that are in the same run .
and that 's just what i can do if i can do that , with two , i can stand on one side , and i have to look at the eyes -- `` hey , '' or can it open up , does n't
and then it 's got to be like that , and then you have to go to the other leg and you 're going to be the same way , and you 're going to make it a little bit , but it has to be really close to
also , with high hair .
yes , and that 's really important for me when i 'm in the middle of what i 'm going to say , how do i say that guy , so i say a guy , because i 'm actually just using men as a
so i do n't know what he needs to say .
so i 'm one who has to come to the way of communication .
and this is like in every way .
if someone does n't know my needs , he ca n't help me , but i 'm just asked , and i must say , well , i 've done a lot of you from the curve , obviously , you ca n't get
or i do n't want to thank you like that , i 'm just saying that all of my time is that all of me , as long as the mountain is of the mountain , because if we get rid of that , you know , it 's not going to be over .
and again , again , just like , and the thing just does n't stop .
and i 'm going to have the same pilot as it goes to the house , and then it says , and it 's like , and it says , you know , it 's kind of a little bit of time .
and so that 's important for me , because of course , that 's the same thing that you 've got to have in the top .
`` i 'm willing ' ma -- here 's another one of those who will also open up to open school ?
who gets more ?
so my best time it was time , but this was in september , and now i was like in april , but that 's my best time i 've never been able to do that much faster .
and at the moment at the moment , at the end of the day ,
and for me , as i said , you know , you 're going to be able to do that , if i just open my ears .
one of the other things that i 've also been doing was exactly exactly what he is looking at , and i have the ability to think of my future perfect .
and that 's a very important thing to do why i say : trust is more training , and not that little staff .
so , you know , you know , as a blind , i do n't mean much of it , '' i said .
because i 've also had the experience that i had a fortune on the left on the left .
and then it was n't bad at the time , because it 's next to three meters .
and i 'm about the three feet .
and so , as i said , that was then -- of course , of course .
that 's what i know when you have , because you have to move around , you 've got to get up open .
and what i 'm still going to do today is that i 'm going to say , and then say , `` on the left and say , `` well , the other side .
so it was right , unfortunately .
do n't often look so much .
but , yeah , in the absence of a situation , with pressure , you do n't know all of your work , or you 're trying to go to quickly .
then , of course , often do n't seem to open up to be incredibly challenging .
but for me , as i said , that 's really trust , because i do n't know the risks .
and i 'm going to tell you a moment , i 'm as someone who do n't see , i have to be relatively large , because i 'm afraid the risks in many ways .
so i do n't buy that , i do n't know that .
so you 're going to make a tree by the nest , and i 'm going to go down and i 'm doing , and of course -- and that 's the important thing -- i 'm doing the good news .
and then you can get it to be able to get if your arm is there .
and if you 've found somebody that 's actually a hundred percent as well as i do .
and with that , i 've got the same thing with that .
because that 's for me , because for me , the next one , is critical .
you need the same thing , and i do n't really realize what is it , because , really , do you need the same thing ?
because that 's often what 's often called five times you used .
i do n't know what i 'm doing or myself .
but the whole thing about this is also a lot of it .
you know , you 're responsible for trust .
and that 's also -- because we humans do everything that 's going to run us in open open -- we want to see more of the sense of it .
and the point that is quite often is that we 're also creating a good target .
that 's what we do -- in my case , for example , i 'm going to take it up .
and that 's where i 'm saying , i 've got to get a look at this , or i 'm actually able to trust a lot of trust in a case that i can only see that mountain up .
and how do we do that at the bottom of the mountain at the moment ?
well , i did n't know , of course , the biggest advantage i 've done , i 've never seen some things like this next to be a hundred meters .
and then it was pretty much successful .
can you have advantage , then there 's a problem of a problem .
and i 've also been working on a hard time , now i 've got a lot of the privilege , and i 'd like to do it for you now , or you went to college in berlin , and there you are going to
and this is kind of a little bit , when you go up there and you go down , you do n't have to see much about there , and i 'm sorry .
and these things have been interesting to me .
clearly , in order to do that , but just to know , `` hey , i war to war , i 'm so focused on this , but you can just do it with new new experiences .
and that 's exactly what she 's doing is a little bit when i think there 's at a black town that 's like this : you 're going to take every day 10 hours , and it 's just a moment that 's a moment .
you go and go , and you have just foot around you , and less plants .
you 're taking your head of your joint , and you 've won the nobel prize at a recent success event .
so if you see what 's going to be a little bit , it 's the equivalent of the last one that 's going on .
that 's the only thing that 's going to happen .
we 've seen the only way from the distance or the other .
and so , when i get there , there 's a lot of trust for me -- despite his kind of notes he did .
because i thought , well , well , like i said , well , like i said , `` well , '' i 'm going to get away away like this thing until this thing .
but , as i said , it 's kind of pretty fast because you 're not going to get a lot of change in it now .
and it 's going to be exciting when it 's going to happen .
so when you go back into the ground , and the air gets off .
or if it goes to a piece , if you 've got a little bit short , where the left on the left and the right is right now .
and then it 's going to be particularly beautiful , and if it 's still left , and all of a sudden , you know , you 've also been able to look at the moment , and now he would like to take me
because i was in the only way to do it , and i was then able to do it .
we have created by making it that i just said , well , of course , i do n't know , my girlfriend , who was about this , a hundred percent trust , and we did that .
but i do n't need a lot of a lot of security , so i do n't mean to focus on , because , you can imagine , if you 're standing on the mountain at the top , right on one , on top of 11 .
it 's going to come out , and it 's all .
so , for us , we have trust in this case , we 're looking for comfort , so we put a laser on their finger , that i had in my hand , and then she was behind her game 's game .
in fact , when i did some research , i did n't have to deal with it at the height of time .
and then she 's at some point , and she 's foot on a foot with a little bit of little hair , or he played with her new york 's house , that i 've already known to know what i 've been doing so on me and did n't
and what i 've really shown all of this is how beautiful it is , if you knew , then suddenly , then the thing really showed you that you really saw that goal was going to be like that , as well as you did
but on the other hand , it 's also so i have found , that trust i 'm going to say that , just because i 've really really have to make a really feel like this .
but the trust is too , in other ways , that 's how they do n't work .
so when we walked up to night , we were in the group , we were mostly in the group , and we 've been talking about the other seven and the ones , and it 's been relatively close to us , and it 's like everybody else behind us
at night , you ca n't look at the queen .
that 's kind of a sense of reason .
and then , you know , i 'm starting to think , oh yeah , yeah , whose trust , in their ability , is quite a stage .
you 're walking down at night through the dark , you 're going to see 12 o'clock at night , and then there 's no light .
it 's totally tough , if you 're wired out , the air will be thin , so you 're just not going to have a little bit more and now , and now you 're not asking anymore .
and then finally , at some point , that 's the moment where they said : well , you know , it was really quite easy to go in front of you , because the friend of me got all excited about it -- how women do it .
so , the whole thing was telling us about this , and the other ones in the group were just like to know , `` ok , it 's just an hour hour , and that 's telling me then .
or i do n't know what i do n't know from the last .
and that 's exactly what you know , there 's somebody else , which is probably as well as well as well as bad as you -- but it 's just an hour hour , the sun goes off .
and that 's true things , and you can think of the outside of the outside , you can also have a lot of a lot of land , and you can actually be able to make a sense of that the normal kind of thing .
and for me , there 's no hope , and it 's particularly like everything , if you look like that , kind of personal and what really wants to do , then there 's the idea right there .
that 's obvious , of course , in the sports of the gold , where you 're going on -- i do n't really know why they can do that , maybe , do n't i know the value , or , if it 's just
so , i think some of the things that i 've done is , it 's like , you know , you know , you know , you know , i
if all the real gold would be , i 'm not going to be here , i mean , i would go , i think .
or at least in the middle of what 's open , for example .
but as i said , i think that 's the real thing about why you do that , it 's more you can imagine , which is what i was doing and how i thought about my skills and the forces of it .
i mean , like , i 've been in my skills , but of course , in the team that we all need to do , whether it 's in teaching , in whatever 's doing this .
anyway , if you 're old man , or young wife , we need to be able to trust them .
and if we had this goal in the head of the object , and it 's also done , then the best evidence that we could have in a project in our lives .
and if you can do that , you can do something in other places .
thank you very much .
a science for me , that 's the title of my talk , which is built to open your beautiful maps .
what i 'm going to do is that the whole thing is designed for the privilege of being a little bit in the general population .
basically , i could be ashamed .
if i 'm going to go into an opera , and there 's all the only thing to do with depression for scientific issues , which is a demographic .
so each student has developed a series of volunteers , some , founder , where science issues are , of course , is the opposite .
so , everybody 's looking at at least one , which is at least , sort of , scientific models .
so , that 's completely stupid , if you look at what it 's like , and you know , for kids , there is scientific issues .
each video has kind of have a bit of a bit of steel , but it 's still a kind of crazy thing .
science is one of the things i like to look at , which i like to read , but i do n't even know that .
cool , cool science is just just sort of like to think of as well , in all seriousness , somewhere , that 's the most difficult sound , right ?
so , if you 're five minutes , do n't do anything to do with reality , but that 's cool , right ?
there , i can see myself .
big bang here , i can tell you , and i do n't understand what 's wrong , but it 's great .
it 's extremely bad .
because that 's kind of a little bit , the future , we 're only going to be able to deal with these technical issues and issues .
but at the same time , it was n't for itself .
i 've got a couple of little examples , just like science , or science , who has now like us .
a very scary example : in london , you 've got a beautiful building built built , missouri , the architect , not like that , we 're making it kind of like that .
what 's happening now is that the air move from the top , and i 've come through a little bit , and they 're going to move around the other at the other .
this was the press , and it was unfortunately , unfortunately , just an epidemic .
bad , the heat has grown so that this poor , who 's actually long for long long long , and that 's where they 're off .
so , for instance , you want an architect , you know , actually , that 's not actually kind of a little bit in physics , because i mean , it 's completely new , that 's kind of a mirror .
so , what i 've found , is , is , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , kind of , compared to where it 's acting out with radiation that has a surgery .
so i really wonder , what has the more design or an architect or where did he ?
now , this is a real example .
now , one of the oldest things that have been going to have about this kind of thing is also the capacity .
so , in fact , this is a couple of years when that was kind of like the media .
and there was the test because it had been completed because plants were changing plants , that was one of the danger .
genes had been tied to green .
genes were kind of bad .
well , oh , there are genes in there .
there were some situations where the market farmers have really had to farmers : hey , i do n't sell .
no idea what that 's supposed to be , yes .
so , yes , okay , okay , we can think about it .
but at the time , i was still involved in the lab as well , and i was kind of a little bit , because i 've been trying to put these bad genes in my bacteria , and they are wearing this open .
and it was totally embarrassing , and came home , and my sisters , `` oh , you 're not happy , what 's going on ?
i like , yeah , i 've been trying to do a small gene in my bacteria , and it does n't work .
that 's what i 've been trying to explain , so somehow , a cathedral , a child , i thought , is it , if i talk about genes , you know what she means .
that was what i was actually meant , so a particular sequence that i was going to put in this place .
but that was what the wife sees .
this woman has never put me back again .
who knows what i 'm wearing ?
genes is a very bad thing .
that 's already a good now for 10 years , and yet it 's kind of conscious .
genes , that 's something else .
now , i was n't quite a long time anymore .
it 's always a gene technology , and it has really been in our language .
`` go to europe '' was a crash .
there 's a lot of noise in a lot of other states , which actually has no genes of genes .
another woman , three times a few days earlier .
yeah , that was a wonderful thing .
but they 're not so old , and it 's certainly not really matter at what kind of thing i might find .
whether the time or the picture , all of these things talk about .
but fortunately , it 's not a good place in the courtyard , but i 'm afraid , it 's not going to be a long time .
but that 's just what makes sense of the population , because they do n't just deal with the issues .
we need to invest in our future with these technologies .
now , it was n't silent , and none of it was the big one , but they 're going to talk about things , and he 's like , which is most real real idea .
and that 's pretty sad .
how do we actually get this information in the lab in the population ?
if we think that little boy , young , a scientist sitting in the lab , has an experiment , kind of , beautiful , beautiful and good , and it 's kind of thinking ,
and then the first thing to go to the professor .
the creator , who , okay , fine , is called his name on top of science , which is always the important in science , of it .
good idea , i 'm still not in the public ; it 's about a concert .
yes , the finance thinks , oh , great , great idea , we 're going to have a knowledge .
well , we 've got a lot of a conversation with a project , a beautiful idea , and that 's kind of actually out out out of the sky .
so that 's what you 're going to do , yes , but who 's actually going to do ?
now , the u.n. 's disease alone , the number of have a common set , a common one .
and all these are going to then are going to work out of cool projects , then then we have over the conference about the stage , of the stress , whether it 's fair , or , you know , or
that 's the way .
on the ground , it 's going to fall down , and it 's going to look up until the really cool experiments , really , really , really cool experiments , who are actually trying to actually create projects , put in these galleries .
so , that 's kind of cool , which is really good , is there 's all of all of you , you know , but what am i doing about it ?
in fact , the only thing that 's interested in this .
in the meantime we call it this , always as well , the height of the iceberg .
so , the way that 's already been interested in this , and then it 's the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good .
well , beautiful movie , the audience who is interested in this , and maybe you 've got to know about it , where it actually goes into those papers .
what do i do with that ?
the ones that were interested in it .
the way that was right now , i call him a name of santa album , who , in the other language , other people , i 've been trying to keep it , i 've been trying to keep it
but again , again , our future will only be able to be able to do somehow , if we 're dealing with these things .
energy , energy , renewables , these are all kinds of issues , but they are , but not really understand , and he 's not really understanding , and he 's not really interested in it .
my project , my idea , is that , in other way , these little young , young , young scientists out of the tower , they 're really completely completely entirely away from their normal medium and give him a course of how to
what happens to happen is that a scientist , i have a thread , we 've been known for good two years , he 's a blogger ; it 's a lot of us not to ask him .
as soon as he played his mouth and talk about his job , he 's left with it .
in fact , these are scientists , who tell you what you 're doing .
it 's like , you know , it sounds , you hear it in the same level of genes .
well , you know , that 's kind of , oh , you do n't know what it is .
so when i tried , look , that 's beautiful , and right , if you 're in a meeting and get to your people , you know , you want to do anything else , you can tell you about
where is the problem of taking it true and ordinary ?
so , i went to school , that 's my idea , these young scientists , who are not so far in the dark , which are a little bit more vulnerable , so i school , that 's how we can react .
it 's for all of you as well , as you always , investors , you want to know what 's going on in the 1960s .
and finally , these are the sales that you 're going to use there , so you have to imagine in the west .
but this is this training , that 's just a story .
so i want you to actually , in fact , on the front of an interview , and you 're supposed to imagine your project , you know , your project of a leader , you 're going , you 're going , you 're going to be honest ,
there 's a quote , i do n't know if the real thing is , from einstein einstein , if you ca n't just explain it , you did n't really understand it .
so , the scientists from the lab and how to think about it , how do i really want to make this really differently differently ?
so the stories are a lot .
so it 's totally modern , it 's everywhere , in every university , but also in the middle of it , i only just get the big ones .
so who 's going to go to the end of the city of the city , and i 'm going to come up with a lecture with a conference .
these are the ones who are interested in it .
that 's where i went back to my apartment .
so , these are the people who are interested in going to go over there , and there 's a couple of letters .
that 's beautiful , there are going to be made , everybody 's happy , everybody 's happy , and that 's it .
so , i 'm still on a second note , say , it 's not going to go to the work of the project .
these scientists are also going to grow up , what do they do ?
because a lot of you really have , focus on the scale .
because scientists , like the research , and how children their world , is the same .
children work extremely extremely scientific .
they 're going to do something about that .
you 're going to try and do it work ?
you go down , you ca n't work , it does n't work , and i 'm going to change the way a couple , i 'll make it even .
children learn extremely scientific .
these are really cool , and i 'm dancing , and i 'm looking at what 's going on , what i have to change is that it works or not .
it 's normal !
but these are many things .
and from that , i think , is really the only way that if you 're going to get out of this , and you find this scientists , you know , in the environment with the kids , with the kids from mit , you know , there are experiments with kids , and
and then maybe you can maybe , maybe some , that 's my hope , tell me the kids that i do , and then i 'm sorry , and i 'm also proud , and then i 'm also proud of these
this is not somewhere in the newspaper that 's not somewhere at night , but his children tell him something that had a video game of software , but then it 's got a bread that it has taken over it and then , and then
and not only do that , then , then , then , of course , david is going on , but also the cat .
that 's my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it 's the first time i 've chosen , i said , yes , no , you know , pray for our scientists , that 's just not subject , that are just other priorities .
a scientist , do n't have to communicate .
yeah , i think , okay , i 'm going to take the next one .
but if you 're kind of working in an art program , you 're in a company , as well as well , and there 's the next one .
thank you very much .
i 'm crazy , the question .
ca n't fly it every day .
the last couple of weeks were terrible .
the weather has made us a big deal of what 's done .
seven years ago i 've been asked if i 'm going to take up here .
i was in front of them , almost 10 years at the ministry of tea in indonesia and in philadelphia .
we 're there right now .
we had been treated as a weapon .
and to me , it was really a bit , well , that 's kind of crap .
what is it that ?
it 's actually ridiculous .
but i also know what i 've learned about this , and i 'm here today .
and yeah , it 's kind of a little bit crazy , but it 's in every case .
it 's beautiful , and it 's exciting and it 's fun .
and i 'm just going to just go back to the next few minutes , a little bit of a little bit of this life of a magazine .
i 'm thankful in massachusetts .
the company has been for a hundred and a half years .
i 'm the president of the staff .
this company , for the last time , it has been around the age of
and the ceo of the staff .
the company has been around for about a hundred or a year .
this is a pencil here at the airport .
it 's called it .
this is a picture that i want to show you , is quite a little bit , this is actually a red image , and it 's a kind of a little bit , or something that does n't really know , that 's actually too big .
so , there 's only a sudden in the middle world .
and it 's actually only one of those things that are probably 10 .
that 's what it shows .
there 's about 20 thousand acres worldwide worldwide .
so that 's actually no market .
that 's not even a technical thing .
this is a ring , a ring .
and the question is , why do you do it ?
how is it that ?
in fact , in the middle of only 10 , since we can still talk about why that is .
just briefly .
and it 's made a little bit of crazy designed here , and it 's taken over here .
it 's very short .
and he had to come up to the u.k. in the world war ii .
then in the first world war , in the world 's first world war died , by the way , built in the world , and they built around the open of a bike city for
and then they got london and so on and so forth .
and when we walked around and eight to london , and there was a big building where they started to fly a nuclear campaign in the english , and the english brothers came along with the title , this time , but not with soldiers , but in
so the story was in there .
and we had a campaign campaign .
but luckily , the customer , was n't so much , because he suddenly realized what was going to be doing behind the old memory of life .
and , you know , it was a little bit for the kind of a matter .
but nevertheless , it was a good campaign in london , except the weather in the north many years ago was very bad and very , very smooth .
and we 're not very much .
then he won , 20 , a filmmaker , daniel animation .
and it has taken a contract that has been sent to america .
this has a view that the entire city nation has ever been changed again , and it 's actually something that was taken off .
there was something in new york in new york .
and the entire american nation has said , we 're back .
this is in all the way that 's happening in this way , and that 's really , this is a little bit of this cartoon from this device .
but then , in fact , every day , and only five , six , seven , seven , seven , have been built in place , and actually only two very big that have been called , and the
meat , a hundred , and then they 're running at the hospital , and they 've got to the end of milk .
it was a myth .
and the nurse then then was the first of all the most complex places i did n't think well .
so next , when it was an event at that time , where an art box , one of the product is , and then it 's never taken afterwards .
and also the other things were being done .
and dance , the last part of it happened to be destroyed .
they 're using the materials for free , fresh , cleaning them .
it was n't like a long ago .
and then they had the roots , and they realized they had the idea , maybe we should do it again .
and i used to do research , because if you make a great product for example , we 're going to do the same thing , but the market .
is it really a market ?
what 's going on ?
so .
that 's what we 're talking about .
now , the name that 's a little bit short , but we 've seen it in time , we have a lot of it .
there are a lot of companies that are built out of this who are built .
it 's today employees , about six billion times .
it 's a real investment , right .
there 's a lot of it .
and that 's what i believe here to come here .
the name is actually a very normal plane like any other plane , but it has , you know , it 's got a gas , you 're not hydrogen , and you 're having a ring of steel .
it 's like a man who 's in the water , and you can have to go out there .
the time is not there to explain that in detail .
and inside it looks like a national network , with a structure .
there 's two types of paper .
we have broken fever , and we 're in the case , and we 're doing .
they do n't have the structure inside the structure , and they 're just like mountains in their own .
these are most of the people who have been built in the world , like they were flying , sort of play .
and there 's only today , as i said earlier , that 's only been paid in the middle of a half of our own , but only by only 20 .
this is what the production looks like when it 's going to be made .
the bottom of the structure again .
and the one is also too much .
comes out of the factory .
climate : the charter of the cat .
what 's happened then there is the brain industry .
it costs about two million pounds of that one .
and it 's got to be affordable , and it has to be affordable , and it has to be affordable , because , again , you have to check that if you were to put it up or a hole that you ca n't keep it .
and you do that in your own little bit , and you see exactly whether it 's going to be yellow .
and at the end of it , there 's a lot of carbon in the way it 's there .
it 's a universal product .
and this is what you see here at the bottom , just a few times .
one thing nine percent , one , 20 percent , is one which is called a thousand thousand thousand times a year in a year .
that 's very very , very good .
this is a factory .
it can see .
but there is another trend that makes us a moment , and i have shown here up here .
we had taken three years ago , when i started off five five years ago , eight years ago , and last year , 70 percent of them or tuberculosis .
and this year in may we were at age percent .
if you took the eight years , my eight years , and you 'd open up , and i want to open it up , then you can say , at least in those eight years , of course , the head of the nervous , is also clear that eight years has changed the
we are horrified .
we ca n't fly through the face .
they want to see something .
and they 're going to have the yeast , or they 're going to grow up every year .
so it 's a little indication that our whole system is not just feeling , but it also means , because we make weather every day , changes .
but because that 's what 's good about the city of a program , almost 10 million dollars , and we are an organic part of this program .
i 'm going to come to this morning .
so the way you 've done here is a game lab .
it 's called the campaign campaign .
and we 're going to go to the center between the surface sea .
that 's what 's called self-assembly .
and the ross line is from italy to square to black island in a coma .
over many many many years of animals , and the way that the air look like , how they react to our things we do on the ground .
so , i 'm just saying , since the top , we 're just dealing with the second .
a great wish .
and if you 're like that , your real world is coming out of work .
so that 's very good .
and here 's another , again , there are some other things .
this is what you 're going to think about a week or a half seconds .
and in ireland , the weather is great , the weather is great degrees , 30 degrees .
the critics say that something had never happened .
i 've got there just wonderful beautiful black days .
and then they were n't so bad .
we were also in africa .
and when you were looking for at night as you were looking at , looking out of sand , you look at mountains , you know , the temperature were produced by 1.2 years .
but you can also ask yourself , this is all africa , is that if you ask you , if you ask yourself , you can ask yourself , for an idea , if you had the film in the movie at the film at the movie ,
so i asked myself , well , what do we do ?
and what are we going to do ?
and at the end , we were doing it for two years .
it was n't even further .
so the whole thing came back then and the project was then .
and one time , he was able to get the pen at the bottom of the sound at the time that he could go to the bottom .
but it was n't that bad .
we had a good deal with good businesses , and they were quite happy .
so this was the prototype .
and i did n't know what to do that .
yes , what we 're doing today is a little bit of fast out of doing this .
what we 're going to do today , it 's about the complexity , it 's about complexity , it 's about growth , growth .
what we 're doing today is the peace at here .
we do , of course .
we 've got to get rid of the internet .
it 's called the first one .
there are also , you know , after 10 , you know , you know , you know , you 've got to need to do that .
we 're used to replace the whole thing for almost five million dollars .
because we 're talking to the clients we 're talking about .
we 're going to do the same thing .
we 've become a joint of water training , which is called by the soviet brothers and being supported by the european states , always to the whole , but also as well .
it 's also affordable and it costs money , and it has to be forever .
the question is , do you go further ?
do you want to continue ?
do you make bigger ?
there 's actually , you 're hungry .
what do you do ?
are you going on the market ?
do you go into the business ?
and that 's what we 've been trying to do .
and then we 've also had a couple of tape .
and so , as a result , it 'd been a little bit of a lot of time , and it was quiet .
at the beginning of the 1930s , there was the mother of tea .
the population of the ancient population has killed him with six million dollars than when he was when there was a fourth number , and it basically essentially , and it was essentially the company , and the people made it a vote .
and that 's actually , at the moment of the greenland river and the other companies , but the other companies , and the other companies would be here , and there would be other companies that would n't be there .
we were in tokyo , tanzania .
we were , and you hear , in san francisco with a client .
it was a very strange thing .
both of these projects are unfortunately .
so , again .
at the same time , we 've won the competition .
because i do n't have an image because we do n't see that as a spring age .
but in america , the year is first of the first year in it .
we 've got three .
we 're going to develop a system like a partner with a partner .
and this is a great success , but at the same time , it 's just known .
so , two customers have been essentially , because it 's not .
why was n't it ?
we really know it .
either the place was n't the right or the company , or you had to go to places or in america , you know , in the last 30 years , made of advertising .
so the people have said , you 've seen this , you 've said , you know , another , again , advertising .
it ca n't really know that you can get there .
and it was much more difficult to get to take this thing , `` hey , people hate . ''
`` oops '' well .
they 're going to run in the year , they 're going to get rid , open milk .
but last year , we were only doing it .
there is no one million million .
that 's bad .
the pharaoh goes over here .
it 's the sense of , of course , but when i think about it , then you 're watching the street , and you and all of the laughter , and you do n't actually make advertising , because your mouth mouth is so beautiful , and it
and we 're great .
so , as i always get to leave , the mistake is that you think we are .
you could still do more about it .
we 've got this kind of furniture at the airport , and we 're like .
it 's not quite true .
we 're doing advertising .
this is an art project , which has called electric valley .
and luria , this is what 's done here at the island of stage .
but the ecx is a difficult market .
and you have to go , and you 've got to go down the line of yourself : does n't make sense ?
we do n't have enough advertising , but the internet has a lot of change , and they 're going through the beginning , because that 's all about everything .
the pharaoh 's major labor , which is why we are now just 10 of 10 of them in the world .
we have three .
two active , one of the water , the baby , three , three , 10 , are active .
so six is six .
that is , in fact , what we 're going to do is actually take the market if it 's actually one .
and hope , that can also be able to be able to do the future .
and what ends up david , the apollo brothers , after his home and paris , five and five , he said , `` have the lights on the game of what is going on .
so she 's beautiful .
do we find beautiful .
we do n't find customers .
we find it 's great , we find great , have a technological value .
we have customers .
it 's not sustainable .
it 's one-dimensional , it 's up .
so , that 's how we 've got to get an oil system until you get it .
and then there 's another year .
there 's also a strange effect , which is easy for it and hard to control .
so , in any case , this is the situation , is , of course , is actually a market .
but still we do .
it 's an icon of the region .
they have the power to do it .
so you just ask the question : what do we do ?
how much money do we spend in the world ?
what do we do for this ?
so what is it that in the form ?
and i 'm personally , they 've been asked me to do something personal , but i 'm actually next to my point of where where i wanted to go down to , and then she 'd open up against this little open car , but it was about
i was also when i was walking for three years when i was born through the coast island , and i 've seen all of the rock , so that 's what i do n't have to do here .
and at that time , there was a set of people who are in the money , and they did n't know what to do it , and it 's almost because of it .
and that 's where they 've come to me .
and i 've taken three years more than college , and now i do this in the hope of hope for a long future .
zero , right ? take seconds , i 'm still ready , thank you .
morton bast
yeah , thank you .
these are my three points that i 'm going to show in the 24 minutes .
why are we now in the realm of the multiverse ?
how do we go to the population ?
and most importantly , what do you do ?
what is it going to ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first piece is maybe a bit more accurate .
but it 's also starting to show the challenges .
a couple of years ago , this was a more difficult thing to explain .
we have a problem today , which is every child .
we have problems .
but it 's still going to be even more time for this , which is the challenges , population growth .
all kinds of exponential are exponentially .
so if you look at it in a recent long time , the example , for instance , will be a very short history in history .
right now , we ca n't imagine that it 's kind of different , and it 's going to keep up .
you know the climate change , the last year .
some people say , well , in the past , it was time , let 's look at the last age years .
so you can look at it as well , and i can do right now .
you can say , well , who does n't need ?
you can also say the ocean is far away .
but then , if you start a little bit closer to look at this , to look at the real challenges , to think things that are really meant to avoid , you have just been doing trouble at the end of health .
it 's just about 30 degrees here .
and there 's the other thing in our cities , in our cities , as well as they are in english or in their cities ,
but it 's also about -- it 's mostly in asia .
think about the himalayas , where those of the big ingredients have been made , and they keep getting water from the top .
it 's not around the planet .
the planet is what we 're doing , because there 's a lot of greater conflicts .
and lo , but it 's about the people who are in the same world very well .
it 's about loss of biodiversity .
it 's turned out .
it 's always less less than that .
this is the area where it 's a part of our neck .
and all of this , where 's that ?
and all of these things , i say , are in one of the other kind of one of the global interaction .
what we 've achieved from the earth is what we consume .
not only that the oil and the rings and the rings , but also the use of energy resources are necessary , but ultimately .
and we just want to see that we do n't like it as possible as possible as we use it to create less carbon emissions .
so , it 's about this , which is actually said to really the whole state of the entire community .
so this is the challenge , not only climate , not only a doctor , two , sort of one car on another piece of life .
unlike it .
our technology completely to change .
now , if we go to look at it and it 's like that , and there 's still left on earth that are essentially so living in the principle of living in the way that is alive , with a series of water that 's a year and year .
in a nutshell , in fact , the human story was three to five tons .
today , it 's gone up until now .
so this is what it has to do this .
and it 's very , very sensitive attention on earth .
it has become more than more than more than more than the earth 's warmer .
and in other parts of the world , they look at africa , much less .
and it 's coming , we have the implications of the impact of us , the rivers , the air , has been much better in the last decades , but it 's essentially what we 've done this in other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world is still less .
and so we also are the conflict that we 're seeing , of course , in afghanistan , where they look at , they look at the features of the american kingdom , and then you see where the products come from .
and that 's there , in particular , which is , there 's a lot of resources where the world is .
so if we want to leave it , we need to do with the subject .
so we have to change , the biggest boundaries are everywhere .
and the thing that we have here in life is n't like that .
this is already called the editor gallery , when he said , the world has enough for everybody needs , but not for everyone .
and there we are , like , the average life has a big life .
so .
that was the sort of taken up .
but i think you need to get the need to understand it 's going to change what it is .
so , again , if i told you , it 's like the way to live in life , which is more .
but it 's always a bit like , at the end of general , but you 've got an explanation , and i 'm going to tell you .
so , what 's actually happening ?
and what we need to find is that , in the rich parts of the world , we do n't have that much of the cost that there are so much of the world that we have so much of a lot of quality of quality , but they do n't even tell us
so , here 's a pretty good rules , but there are people , and you probably know the people who are n't so far as well with this story .
i 've done it .
so , genetics and climate change is the same cause .
we work too much , and too hard .
this is on the one hand , and that 's what we 're going to do , and at some point it 's too much .
i also like to work like that .
and on the other hand , we 're going to use these benefits .
so , what 's a good life ?
how do we define that ?
now , a little bit of scientific selection .
and the thing that i said , and what i 'm going to say , i 'm going to talk to you -- i 'm going to show you about it , but here 's the thing that i 've said before , how can i do that ?
and there 's important , there 's always two aspects .
life has an issue of emotional conditions like me , what i have to eat .
did i have a roof over your head ?
are i friends ?
am i relationship , can i live in life ?
but also , how does it go to me , how do i do with that ?
but i 'm afraid of that , sometimes , of course , of course .
and then , of course , i have two words that are going to be important .
that 's a need .
the need are the very fundamental dimension of our human development , of course , to make sense .
if we can get our needs , then we 're happy .
and you ca n't tell you , you ca n't have sustainable or not sustainable .
do n't need to go back to charity .
what are the need ?
in fact , you know , you know , well , you know , you know , various scientists , i just
and you see , you see , of course , the physical needs , but also need to security , to social relations .
it 's for protection , to demand , for creativity , for creativity , for creativity , for freedom .
that 's all done a little bit .
but not a big part of that , but the question is , how can i put this in my life .
and i 'm there to the second important term .
the strategies .
the strategy i 'm going to do is to give me the needs to give me the needs .
and that 's where it 's already going on , this can be a way to do with a high use or a little bit of use .
there 's a lot of money i need a lot of money or small money .
my models are just my behavior as i wish my needs .
it has to do with my values , with the resources , with the opportunities i have .
if i do n't have a lot of money , i do n't help my needs to be in -- if i have a lot of money on my life .
it 's about all around you , which is the roof over its head , and then you kind of look around .
and here we go , it can be a lot of a lot or a little bit , that can be a kind of sustainable or more .
and if we get the whole relationship that i have to deal with my needs , let 's talk about a life .
so .
that was the kind of scientific thing .
and now we 're going to do now , can we do now ?
how is it going ?
and just a couple of reference .
and of course , you 've got to find that kind of thing .
but the evidence of the individual species , in a technological way , here is , i think , a lot about technology , and ultimately , in a political way .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so where do we go ?
the slides at the beginning , in particular , is the danger that we have always been able to look more and more co2 .
the last thing that 's going to do is , because the laws are getting worse , and then we 've gone back in our last .
or , if we can do it , kind of into a different direction with less , but perhaps with less but less but less , but with a better quality of life .
there 's one of my favorites , maybe some know of you have been taken off of what this topic is , you know , more quality quality with fewer money .
there 's a lot of technology technology , how can i be every single thing that we use here , the computer , the orange , the coffee , how can i do this ?
so i can make a different way today , i can build the house of wood , etc .
in order to make a lot less , we can create the same quality of living .
so , my other teachers , when i put this up , who 's a shower per hospital , and there 's when we think about it , which is already now for the last time , there 's a really deep place to look at it .
where are the need ?
so , what services can i do ?
and how can i do this with more ?
and not with a little bit less of it , it 's a little bit less , or it 's a little bit less percent .
there 's a lot of examples that can do that .
in 2012 , one of the tower is built by 2015 .
and with seven , you 've been built built .
it 's basically made out of wood .
you know , if you can not take it in a year and then again and again and not in the parts , so you do n't have much less resources using everything else , you 're going to be there at the end of the end , and the goal is at
but it 's also a lot of things in our own , like , what are i doing ?
now , a nice book has written a wonderful book .
where he shows how hard it is to look out of the way out of that tube .
the nurse , i do n't want to take a look at the other , and then i 'm going to be like this in this race .
so , you have been able to be able to know , kind of , which i was very quickly , and then i do the new one .
in the most glamorous , i mean , you know .
when i started my project , we had written letters .
and then you have kind of wait to your letter , and i 'm calling email , and it 's a little bit mark .
so , for me , i 'll run hundreds .
and i can do a lot more .
this is natural growth , we 're going to come back to it .
but i did n't really have time .
i 've done for me .
but there 's good examples , three food , for example , where i really want to kind of -- how do i really think about how the quality of quality and the safety of the staff go in .
and with a tiny lack of money , i can make more living .
one of my favorite examples is a remix .
now , there 's a great thing that you 've seen is that even average one of us in germany , in spite of thousands of thousands of thousands of things in their own .
you can begin to count that .
who , in fact , three generations of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands
they have given us the evidence .
we have to engage with it .
and there 's less and less people with that , all of these things .
and we need a mechanism that will help us work with these little things .
now , if i 'm interesting , i might be interesting , you might be going to be able to have taken off of the room going out there , and i 'm not there , and there 's not a bunch of thousands of things
the next example of this is using instead .
there 's a real picture .
now , filmmaker , libya , perhaps , 20 years ago , have been done in a developed fashion .
in the meantime , it 's always more people if you think of thinking .
if you think about cheating .
meanwhile , the way that you can do with it , how can we do things that we 've already made this beautiful box that a few hundred years ago that was going to be able to use before , and even more than one more years ago , that 's
that 's what 's going to be able to do better .
this is a question of justice justice .
and i 've given you a little bit about how do they do that as a picture between africa and europe and an effective world .
so , in the same way that all the same time can use these resources is only possible if we just use less .
and that does n't mean a lot of life , because many of us have already looked like that .
but it 's an important job about the economy , the consumer , these products , these services , are really available to the goods that we need to create a good life with a much less resources .
last thing that has done something about the political politics after the growth , when i do that .
if you think about a little bit about the print , then there 's a period of time , and you 're going now , and now you 'll see that every week , it will come back to the bottom .
it 's called , yes , there 's a crisis in front of my view , and what we 've been talking about a lot of knowledge with scientists , and that 's kind of , you know , here 's the numbers of
and there is no reason to grow up , like , like , like , how i looked from my youth .
in part , there 's a complete mathematical problem .
one thing five percent growth is so much about eight percent growth in front of years ago .
and the eight percent is what china has today .
they 're also about where we might see ourselves before .
if you get a little bigger , you know , of course , it 's very even eight percent .
that 's one percent that 's still a lot , so that 's going to be good .
but you have to put it in terms of it , which is not if we had zero zero to zero zero , you know , in the next year , you have to grow in a lot of places that means , and
we can do it well , and we can work with it .
it 's not that kind of thing , because you know these statistics , they 've never seen their growth on the quality of life .
the economy is growing , but the quality of life has been around in terms of what we are .
and by the way , by the way , there are no growth in the way without growth , and it does n't look as close to us , and how they 're all going to get back us back and how they 're all called
it 's just not , and then you have to go through the economy of economics .
and it comes back and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
well , he played out of santa , who 's put in love with his album , he said that he said that good life is the good economy , the good company made the good life .
that 's not the last thing , and it 's not about not to create services , not necessarily growth growth for our countries .
for example , and for those countries , also for china , for india there , it 's a very different story .
and that 's only going to be under when we 're going to grow to this , and we 're just looking at the level of things on this level , based on this very high level , which we 're doing right now and
it needs about politics .
it needs goals .
it needs to have , say , economists .
it does n't need that growth , but we should really measure and measure and ask questions , what is it in the quality of life ?
is that food ?
and then our politicians measure .
so , of course , what 's the consumer ?
how do they do this ?
we need a fundamental aspect of what 's going to go and not work .
those of you who are particularly familiar with you , but you also have the kids , you know , well , do n't know .
what kind of food goes on , we know , even after a colleague , he 's paid for a student .
you could do that very differently .
the resources are in terms of that , and therefore , those are the resources and not work .
and finally , you have to get all of them to create health care system , health infrastructure , infrastructure .
that 's what you have to do , but there 's a little bit of work .
that means that , in fact , more or less , can be able to work in this direction , we can work hard , we can think of as businesses that are right right for us ?
what do we need , and what do we need ?
right , the real policy is to get rid of action .
a couple of reasons i have received .
and finally , of course , the science of science is still lost percent of all the time , how do we increase growth ?
but unfortunately , none of it .
if you look at the formula , if you look at the development of those last two years , it goes down to sea because it 's not .
politics does n't create , and it 's not going to create growth , but that 's the question of how we 're going to deal with it , and is it that we have a good life ?
so , let 's do it anyway .
you 'll notice that , if you look , you 're going to see the
with heart , brain , hand , hand , and finally , we 're going to make it work .
thank you very much .
i 'm thankful .
and i love this city .
this city has so many stories .
one of them has been a few hundred years ago .
and has to deal with creative engineering .
in this creative , i 'm going to come to the same way , and i 'm going to show you a story later .
you 're going to have to do it with the force .
this is arthur 's dance , which is here in the middle of this city , and much of this city has also changed .
another story .
it was in a hot hill in venice , texas .
a man knows how to get in love with his shoes in love .
it 's too warm .
he 's anonymous , he does n't know that .
he 's doing it , he 's making it , and it 's making it long as long as long as long as a result , and a lot of holes in there are many holes in it .
and he 's going to take his head back and he 's going to be a new climate .
it 's the breath , it 's not born .
and these numbers , which you see here is the actual position in the journal of the maltese falcon of the maltese falcon .
a company has been made with four letters .
one or some of you know it .
he has taken the original idea in it and killed .
both have done .
so , he says , well , honey , i do my own company .
he goes to the stock market .
so today , several thousand people live in a number of toxic countries in the world .
so much of the theme of creative problem .
why not something new , which is n't there ?
and it turns out , maybe that 's a question that comes up with .
if you do n't know , it 's an opportunity for what is it ?
now , that 's a question that has been given me for a lot of difficult situations .
if something is wrong , or you do n't have to do it or technology , or technology does n't work .
`` oops , little , memory , etc .
what 's an opportunity ?
and you 're going to get off of your head into the center .
so , what i can do that ? i 'm going to show this example .
and another example , of course , came from , and that 's the very popular idea of comedy .
and the idea of how creative people might be when they care about their own .
i want to show you a few examples here .
so these are actually built out at the main stage , and it 's made it a dollar .
i love the fantastic .
my son did n't have the wife .
he 's just finished , and that 's the wife of the library of eden .
or i had the whole day every day , when i left the plane , suddenly suddenly i was a teenager in my 20s , and i could n't see the other car .
it 's obvious who is it , right ?
the bush .
they 're wired .
i 've come up and two times almost died .
you can , at least , at least , half the fifth of your laptop .
the last thing i was at the crash was not .
you know , you 've got the young wife in the classroom .
if you 're a man , there is another explanation for you .
if you 're a woman , you do n't understand it .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish to myself , and i dreams that we all need more of this creativity .
a lot of us are in a factory .
and it does n't have to be that way .
why not things do differently ?
old things that we 're doing is that we might feel as well as well as or as their voice .
why not just do that , as a little bit simple .
and there 's so , you know , you know , you 're going to use companies .
for example , for example , you 've got these glasses of your workers , you know , these guys , or for example , and there 's perhaps what it is .
one possibility , right ?
so let 's go to a coffee instead of getting to the head .
or something .
we do n't have disposable , you get you .
now , it 's already like , right ?
if you ca n't do the cell phone .
or eat you , at the same time you are both .
curiosity , but creative .
that 's what it takes .
i 'm asking for one of the clients , or then we would turn down and say , okay , that 's what i like .
that 's what i do .
so , when a graduate pilot has done in the front of the year , and it 's in bali .
once i 'm going to give you the current news , you know , in politics .
if you were three times three on this thing you are in .
well , one of the people who wrote over there too long as food .
it 's a joint building and it 's a restaurant very small , so you had to do the most powerful hands .
it was too deeply .
they 've got , in common , what do we do ?
how do we solve the problem ?
we can not get faster in the kitchen .
this idea is created .
on every table , she 's going to make a free store , clean fresh of salt salt , salt and shelter .
so , the fact that in the front of your food , you can actually eat your car back in times .
just so different .
it 's a creative idea , and maybe it 's now .
there 's one person who is not just right now .
this is a person who is the leader of the company , so the owner of the factory .
and in fact , the german union .
and the second day , this is going to wait , so four days .
a company , for example , they 've put a company called the company of the month , and they may have seen what .
a department says , instead of , we thank you .
people are coming to us .
the homes are in full , it 's called people , and people are going to go in love because everybody 's going to look for other people because of a to b .
but why do n't even seem to do anything like this , and how do they make something ?
sometimes , as a result , creativity is obsolete .
and it 's coming from an airplane , like this , you know , you might know .
so we said , well , that it 's not really good at the seti , but that you should also have to have to stay in the hospital , but you 've got something wrong .
or if you 're in the car .
so we know , you know , you know , you know , we 're going to have them all kinds of directions .
yes .
why do n't you go into the car when you 're hungry ?
or at ideo , we have some ways to make the creative creative .
and all this has to do is just with humor , with joy , at times it 's stupid , right ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once my father son at me was in office .
and sitting on this kindergarten in front of me .
so , we 've done several two clips about this .
and then it turns up to the left to the right , but he 's got joy , and i 'm going to tell you what you 're going to do , you know , that 's not a beauty here .
he said to me , look at a lot of eyes , i think it 's a big place .
and then , at the moment , i 've actually got the right , right ?
why is n't that no ?
why is that what we 're doing is n't the cure for adults ?
now , that 's a lot of things , right ?
if we 're acting , if we use our talents to do what we like to do .
and so they can do it , but they do n't make sense .
the thing is that when the last day of the week is changing in our brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow it 's our focus on another day .
that 's another day , we all have a longer day .
that 's what it looks like .
you may hear that , you know , in the media .
but the way it means yes , is just a day .
or , if you look at the same time of year , it 's going to talk .
what are the rest of the rest of this year ?
is it so terrible ?
are we all so terrible jobs ?
and one of them wrote it on the front page of this issue .
yes , yes , i and the rest of life , please please .
or on facebook , on facebook , all over the social networks of social networks , the subject is happening .
i used to go through the factory , one of the tea in l.a .
there 's a lot of businesses , and i look like this .
what do you have in your home , what is there ?
and one day , i was going to buy this business with that for example .
and the first sign you see here , yes , that 's actually quite nice .
so , from working with that love , rather than trying to work .
well , i 'm wearing this , and i 'm father with five children , but i love my work .
yes .
or even a little bit of health care is the running sign .
so , why is , why is , why is , why , look at your own sense of view , and there 's always more and further .
someone once there is , as an answer to this point , it 's not the bus , it 's your jobs .
and actually , i 'm actually going to sleep with the pink , here 's come here and say , okay , okay .
what about my job is beautiful ?
and the paradox is , even though it 's the pink , it looks like before .
so , being a little bit beautiful , that 's not beautiful , it 's not obvious .
the pink bar is actually going to open to a bike .
you 're going to take a wonderful that you 'll fly in your body .
but fortunately , she does n't .
where does this happen if we do n't change that ?
in fact , the job , the content , our hearts ?
inside of the business , outside as a nation-state .
it might end in a system where we feel like the mouse .
the mouse is going to be in this and open and open and goes , and eventually it 's going to become fast , and this is what it takes to the poor mouse and it comes out .
what is the mouse ? ''
you do n't know anything else , you 'll go back in that dish .
and again , again , maybe the movie of the movie again , you know , of course , maybe you will never think of them , you feel it .
this is beautiful , you 've got here in front of you , so she 's got there , and it 's always going back there and again .
and what we think is , as a funny , is n't the point of the day , right ?
or something does it takes for sale .
i was like it a lot of years ago when i was on the road at home .
and in fact , the street looked like me , it was very black to my eyes , and i have just got to stay on .
the next day i went to the doctor because i thought , what 's going on here ?
he looked at me and said , `` well , everything is fine .
but what does it look like ?
and i looked in my blog , and i saw it , and i saw it , and i had three weeks , and i sort of liked my job .
after two years , of course , teachers , the first question , which is first of the early questions , whether we can do that night at night .
i also thought , well , what is it still for jobs ?
and i started getting down , making another thing , looking at time with my family , doing something good for myself .
`` now , if you ca n't get any more happy , in my job , a new one .
i figured out the stories of a lot of groups that are really happy to me .
so i 'm going to go to `` like , '' and i 'm talking to myself , and i 'm other things , but i get to give these talks to experience experiences , experiences that are really happy to me .
and it was n't always that .
i also have to recognize myself that makes this decision to make action .
and so , sometimes the right thing is going to be front of this picture , and when i had gone back to the hospital after he had a heart attack , and suddenly he starts to go .
once i said , you 're going to walk with me , and he 's always going to go up , you know , you 're going to go to it .
today , he goes .
so , with plastic , beautiful slowly , at the right , but eventually , we 're going to go through that .
what happens ?
we 're going to get rid of that .
going down down , but a curve , which is growing , is an epidemic of social health .
five percent in the last 10 years of 10 years ago , five years ago , five years ago , that 's beautiful , that 's less .
one of the mental diseases , plus plus .
this is something that i think , is it that i need to think about this ?
why is that ?
is it just so successful ?
no , even in germany , it 's like that .
it 's yeast , you know , that 's all going to happen .
that 's the way on the left side .
in the bottom of three cases , almost plus a hundred percent of the last 10 years will find a great german factory .
and the number of killer of these babies take up .
the cost .
and it 's all about all kinds of , what can we do with this topic ?
now , do you do that , sometimes , sometimes you 've been able to do this as well as you 're here for example
so it 's good .
and somebody said , no , no , no solution .
but what about the solution ?
what is that , what makes us feel healthy and how to make joy ?
and that 's what i 've done for the last few years .
i 'm thinking about , you know , there 's something like my house , is there something else ?
i 'm a believer , the job is not what 's going to make us care and happy .
there are many other things that are important , family , health , and so on .
but the fact is , we 're going to spend the biggest part of our work in work .
and if we do that , why do we do that , it 's safe to us , and it also comes to it .
and i 'm going to give you the free juice that i 'm going to give you free to the final thing that i 've got to do with the last thing that
these little instructions , you know , then you 'll be able to feel that .
it 's an important for commitment , freedom and environment .
that is , how do i do my research ?
in the environment , i do that , even with the person ?
so , what freedom is i do that , do what i want to do ?
because it 's the degree of the heel that 's us .
the more you , more stress .
and what do i do ?
this is the same thing .
these are the four areas .
and it can anybody for themselves .
i had to do that for myself , a few years ago , and i always do that .
can i use my apps ?
so , in the environment ?
and that , sometimes i 'm going to put in a basement with my laptop , and i call it on a fire , or you have a hat .
the freedom .
which means i can take myself to do what i 'm important .
and do i do it ?
this is the same thing .
so the last chapter magazine .
and then there 's always some people who tell me why this is not .
and why it 's much more difficult .
i 've never been looking at it like an answer to this point .
who wants to find ways .
who , not , has a reasons .
and at the point , can you feel like this , i mean , i think , do i think , or do i have reasons ?
and they 're going to have in both right .
so , what do we do about our health ?
each one of you has lost his big open .
it 's too small .
it 's filled with food , with gold , with everything , with your skills .
what do we do ?
by the end of the day , we 're asking it .
or if we 're in the hospital , or at the end of a life .
what did i do with my life ?
by the way , who 's here for me to open up , can i like to stay back here .
so , what do we do with our brains , is my first question , but also to myself , and it 's every day .
do i mean good enough ?
and resources .
there was something else about a story .
and i wanted to tell you about what i was about .
and that 's what i do for the future .
and that 's where it was taken up the hospital for the last time that was a little bit of police .
and the enemies realized that this machine was so well that you could n't take it .
there 's fresh walls of a lot of local ways that goes into the water , and you can see black cameras in front of them .
it was in front of it .
so we thought that , okay , if we do n't come inside , we make a ring .
we do n't walk out there anymore .
so let 's watch like this .
and it did it take long until the day , where the people were almost used to use .
and they had just been a grant that was already on the way to become a little bit of the time that 's when you 're going to die , and i give you this up and give me three days .
thank you , pray , you 've got you , and i 'm scared of you , come up and let us .
you go off with the hard way .
at one point , the ears like over the wall of the rings of the department of the led , '' will always get back to the left to the right to the right to the right , and in the early '90s .
well , think of what , if you have a toothbrush , what 's already going on .
it 's gone .
again , a little bit dynamic , on the wall of the mouse , it 's not black black .
you think oh , oh , you know , you 've got two , but you 've got something else .
the same thing 's going on , and this time , he 's white , who 's up there .
at the end of the second day , after the six of fish have seen down , they are in a dish .
because they thought it takes us too long , and we do n't think anymore .
and then they went down to open and open to the camp .
one that you had and you put it up .
and it 's made up of the experimental industry .
i like this idea that everything is there , what we need and we need everything .
sometimes it 's hard resources , sometimes it 's not a lot , sometimes it 's .
but again , we can do something about it .
we do n't know what the power we 've created the world every day .
and if you think that might now be a good thing to do , then you have right .
in the spring , the spring .
it 's coming .
and we know , we know , in the way , because of the mountain there is going to be warmer because it 's going to be used to plants the plants on to be green and green .
there 's going to come out at some point out of these filters .
and so there goes from here very , then we eat and eat .
and there 's a grain of cells , then we can then turn and make bread .
there are any animals that eat .
there are people who then eat the money out of it later .
and it comes out .
but if you think about it , that 's not going to be a fear of fear and enthusiasm .
and of course , this may may be just very abstract , and it 's also very glamorous , but just in the area of biodiversity , the connection of inner brain to the plant , is a very , very big deal .
there are the research that show that up to 98 percent of our food , there were going to be no longer if we do n't have bees .
now , it sounds so popular because it 's so normal for us , and we might not see bees in the future .
there was a very interesting movie , a very interesting film , a very interesting movie , a theme .
and i assure you , look at it .
but now , we 're going to be on the top of this guy 's working with bees work , who 's in his school , in making sense of what makes sense of change .
this is what he 's doing here at a school of school , and he 's now going to tell us a little bit about his work .
please , mr. susie .
yes , good evening .
first of all , a big thank you have a big thank you , and you end up at all .
i 'm here with my project , personally , of course , is going to be able to be able to talk about the life of the bees .
and also , under a writing , a little bit of fun , that 's fun .
because i 'm going to suggest that the number of you now , will be a free company to put you in a hospital in english minutes .
i do n't like that .
but maybe i feel like to convince you that they 're going to start to love those love to , or to kind of empathy that they 're starting to develop and to develop them for this kind of system , as opposed to the viewer .
my name is thomas jones , and i 'm a blogger , with a wonderful woman , father of five kids have not been in love and thousands and thousands of tanks and music for years and has been doing
i 'm a member of a member in the jungle , and i 'm a member of a member of college .
and now my work is now , at mit , with our former students with our senior students in the classroom .
we 're going to work in the garden in agriculture , in agriculture and in general .
now , basically , it 's a little bit of chocolate ' and is used to cradle .
our next classroom is more likely , a silence , a quiet thing .
and it also continues to silence .
it 's almost a revolutionary .
and not necessarily have the old leaders who are in the relationship between free , and they call a little company called open .
and in a wonderful play , he describes how he opened his legacy to the stage of his led to him to make him he can grow .
but if you do n't go in there , they 're going to send your blue bees , and you 're going to make the face of pink , and you put it in your mouth , and then you see that words like
a beautiful picture .
hopefully , it 's going to me this tonight .
yes .
this is a flying kid .
i come to the project .
one of these rides , this is a little student that 's my students with me , and for 30 years , for example , she 's going to have an emergency day .
in japanese schools , from us to college , or in the suburbs , they were building in the city of buildings , or in the '80s .
a search for tea or in southeast us in their own .
the teacher , this project , i 'm talking to the class , and we 're looking for a straight place for that .
so , usually the windows up , so you can see the children during this month .
and all of the things that can then be in there , and they can be able to do it again .
and then they 're built on the window .
so .
and then it starts all the way to me .
so , i 'm going to take a free and post it now made two of them , and now put them here in this room .
so the important thing about that on those are , of course , of course .
also , we 've got here to be here at here , and we have to be here at the bottom of two , very fresh .
and then you also have a ring up here up here .
there 's the honey inside .
you need that if it 's bad and you ca n't fly .
so .
that 's what it looks like .
and then you come back and immediately , you know , you know , you 're going to run a lot to where you 're going to do it in school , or you go in school , in school .
and now it 's something wonderful .
ladies and gentlemen , these bees live in there , and then the class has come to a crisis .
your people are n't going to be more .
they 're dead .
you do n't find your queen .
and this is the most important job about this when he makes these open decisions , that the queen is going to be in the old .
so that 's not the two of these two .
and they 're going to be sad , these bees .
they start to travel .
yes , this is what 's called , you 're running .
you hear that .
they 're almost less than if they do n't usually go in their homes with a queen .
and now , it 's starting to get a gallery .
ladies and gentlemen , at a night , they 're now going to have the need to have a new way , and all of this is happening without , not , without conferences , without conversations , without understanding , without beliefs .
here 's the people who are able to do , and then it 's the first night here .
because without the queen , it would n't exist after six weeks .
because it 's only six weeks long .
so .
and in that first night , she 's coming from one of them to take a pen out of an egg and put it in that dish .
and then there 's going to be a queen .
anyone who got from you in high school , `` how is that going to go ?
yes , you 've got rid of light , but they 're all genetically boots .
that 's true .
and now it 's something wonderful .
now , that 's an example of what i 'm going to do in the order of what i 'm going to do a nuclear machine is to be a queen
that 's the hospital again , the first three days of the genetic code , like the wings .
after that , it will be used to fill by a predator .
you know that term .
and immediately , changes on this line of water is changing code .
and they 're going to move through that little bit through the system .
we 've heard it already heard that what we eat is what we eat .
and the queen is really wonderful to experience .
so three days , five , five days .
and that can all the students .
this is what you see in the class .
and then it 's going to have this cell , and it 's called it , and it does n't happen to the whole thing because it 's the people who are now helping to do or because of a sudden , it 's going to be
no , this is happening .
ladies and gentlemen , this is a dance or a genius .
and then wait for the student eight days , each of my students , you know , three five eight eight , so that this queen is apple .
and on the day , so if that 's going to happen , the teacher 's going to show up the wire in the garage , because he 's the piano lectures for the students in the morning , yes .
and then the mother says , `` well , what 's going to talk to you ?
yes , i need to school .
yeah , why ?
yes , the queen .
yes ?
and then you 're in school at school .
and then you 'll have taken your fingers up on this line , because you want to use it as the queen is now .
and if you can see that , you 'll hear something first .
this is the queen .
so .
a little bit higher .
and then they come in and cut the queen .
the first thing that they do is they take their wings , and there are now in their heads of that people , which themselves have a queen to their ears , their allies , their allies .
now , the people has now an identity .
now , for three to five days , this queen 's queen .
from the nurse , she 's going to hold her to call her to a call .
the back comes out of it , from the people out of this .
and after five days , those of the queen go out of what they were doing .
now , a couple of you think , yeah , i 've seen it already , and i have a ring in a coma .
okay , so stop .
something else .
that 's what we do .
this is a queen that 's flying now alone with no training , not from it , from that point up to two miles high .
you 've probably seen something in your book .
in the '80s , and it 's at the moment in which it 's going to be used in a hospital store , from seven to 12 to 12 to 12 , to say , to be
so , the other way , like in islam , where the women 's different women have here is the queen , who has seven to 12 men .
and the whole thing happens in a wonderful way .
the drone comes from the back of the queen , and this letter is now in this decline all of all the time that they needed to pay for three years .
for the drone , it 's an amazing experience .
if you 've done it with , and it falls dead in the sky .
and then the queen goes back and starts going to set up eggs .
there 's always one , two student in the class that immediately you see .
and they also see the queen .
yes .
and then the project starts to do the project at school , because now they 're going to go back and the queen and the queen 's going back , and the queen 's going to be there too .
and then , i come to one night that i had before .
`` oops '' at the end of the outside , and the next morning , i 'm going to leave this with the queen and those bees to me .
and there are the queen .
yes .
geoffrey chen .
and it 's almost 10 to 12 years old .
and then , this is yes , these two baby come here at a time .
in a full of the car , in a shower , and now the people can become big and cheaper .
why bees in school ?
ladies and gentlemen , the kids who have never seen this , never forget .
yes .
it 's not just that , in this class , that 's the students who are all the time with the bees , but all of them come to this class .
and the teacher , if he knows something if he can do something if he 's something that it can take one time after another .
so , look , bees and doing n't -- when we started , we 've got a couple of thousand thousand years ago , where people have already known the honey .
a couple of months ago , you had a living in israel for israel 's old year when people have the bees in the bees .
any human culture has done with bees .
or the way , the bees , the bees were in every culture .
in china , in india in india , in egypt , in chile , in rome .
everywhere they were .
the human cultures , ladies and gentlemen , they are .
he can run a factory , he 's a shower , he 's able to have a shock .
ladies and gentlemen , you know , these flowers , or trees , the bees , what you need ?
that 's what you find out there is something in the summer in agriculture .
this is out there , this is a green desert for our bees .
yes ?
so he can go home with the students in front of the jungle and where there are flowers and there are flowers available bees , and when they look at them , and look at how long now we need to get from here to the flowers ?
how long did you pay attention to the individual ?
and how long , you need to come back to them .
he can make it dance .
how do i get a banjo ?
yes .
you know , is that that 's what 's going to be at the top , or is it cool to the side side ?
look carefully .
he can tell you an math -- which is a nest .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he 's actually going to open up to the most of the students in this room .
and then , he 's like , how could he had a ceo of high voted for britain ?
because it turns out that the bees is going to see this .
but , ladies and gentlemen , you know , in a light , it 's dark .
there 's nothing wrong .
and just at the professor of professor , who worked a lot of years at university in university , he has been able to make sure that the bees will sit in there and make a bow .
like a clean network in the stadium of the mouth , i 'm going to make a loan to you , and now , you 've got to see what kind of cool web , and the bees , the bees , the one with your legs , with their
do you see what those bees do at school ?
it 's a little bit popular , and the children are losing losing the fear of the bees .
and develop a shift for the bees .
they learn , they learn , look what the bees do .
and you get a sense of these creatures , which is basically only for us humans .
the bees ca n't make a hundred billion per million per year .
the only way , however , the only way to make toast .
they 're collecting their sperm outside the nest outside the trees .
this is a dance , where it 's your people out of .
and now imagine this time , in summer , that 's like , you know , you know , you live in such a permanent space , at a little scale .
hey , there 's no photoshop .
no , the bees do n't .
because you have in this kind of organic antibiotics .
they collect the pollen , and by the way it 's going to him it , it 's going to be used to a place of water .
someone who 's at the head of smart , smart , of course , who can go to a concert and make a break that it 's actually coming out of the people .
now , of course , there 's a grid in front of us , and it 's filled with a metal and so on , there 's nothing .
yes , and then ladies and gentlemen , the whole field of these will do that , and we have to have less warning if there 's not going to fly there , or we 'd like to fly the chinese in their
there 's a lot more about it .
if you look at the gate , out there on the side , there is one of the growth in the middle world , where the cows are going .
and there 's going to be the bee , and then you have to grab your elbow and open up this .
and now the cow and the cow , they get their shoulders , and they just because they 're running open , they can tap off .
yes ?
and then they 're going to do this again and , ah , yeah , yes , i 'm wearing shit , ah , i can do it again .
and then there 's milk .
that 's the bee .
yes ?
and the good thing is going to give us what 's going to be out of nature .
the honey .
i want to come to that point .
so my students are going to make these homes every year , and then i 'm going to go to the schools .
now that 's not my fault , but once i had a graduate student , and i said , in college , in college , you said , `` you do n't make it yourself . ''
and then he says , yes , i 'm hot .
i come from a bike with my bike and i 'm a half years .
and i 've been at princeton for about five years , and since two years at thomas , at the airport .
and i 'm very pleased , and i do n't need to learn about it , but with the hands .
`` oops , yeah , with your head .
and a pilot went through the open , high school .
and more than half of them said , oh , we do .
so my students here is an incredible lot of the world and the gap between being , the normal and the most vulnerable of people in the bees .
so , if you look at them , they 're going to be engaged and they 're going to be nervous , and my students , and they
how do you go like that ?
the question is wrong .
you 've got to say , how do you go to the head of your office ?
and i think there 's the person who 's given the other people and give him a new goal .
and he says , well , you start .
at the end of the end , a little bit of poem from `` fingertips . ''
who 's like the bee 's going to feel that the way through the nervous , it 's never going to move the direction of what it 's going to be the fields in the wild , as he even though , he
thank you very much .
hello , dear friends around .
welcome to my presentation of mine .
the project of my fellow and my wife .
it 's the fight for one end of the female 's product .
in my view , the biggest majority of humanity , because it has been known for years since now .
the society against the women still live on the other day .
first of all , i mentioned .
my name 's a banjo , i 'm coming from .
so , i made a medical medical years ago .
you can remember that at me , the job has n't been .
i did n't feel guilty .
and i was happy to say , i was able to take a good thing in the subject of music .
for example , this one .
with a massive explosion of the united states across africa to brazil .
on the 1930s , a report on the ninth islands , the highest war at the last stage of india , was going to prevent the banjo .
this was a train where i was more women than my bike , more than a nurse .
but nevertheless , this was such as such as the interest of the media , and even a little human being that i could give up his best in the world .
in fact , i went off with a little bit of debt that 's called central in ethiopia .
at that time , there was war in between us and south africa , and we 've been doing these profiles there .
and despite all the time that we were experienced , we were at the other side , the cognitive sequence of the ladder , which brought us up in black , white .
and before it was that we were being sold , and our two boats that you see here on your body as a living player , and the chickens said , that 's my favorite .
if you want to kill your parents , you have to come through .
i found something like that in any other culture .
and then , back in the age of young years , you 've already learned that you ca n't think about islam from terrorism .
but also , you do n't want to say yes , at your terrorism .
so , for example , they 're going to have
the liver , the snail .
but rather than the real nature of literacy , social responsibility .
these are the values that are worth to fight .
after many years , i 've been a little bit at this time , with my wife .
and then we heard about this to female female .
now , when i heard about it , the next percent of the ordinary victim , is the killing of christians , and the other reason , i thought , how can a power form like the koran does n't feel like that ?
and the idea was , of course , the highest government of islam that leads to explain how to explain the practice .
we were looking for them for young organizations , we did n't find it .
since we had to hear ourselves now , we would be completely completely cold , who islam is n't really afraid .
you would choose me to the cat .
at the fort of international international , we 've created our own organization .
and it was surrounded by curiosity and shoots .
and so , in order to do this battle , we need to win the images .
it was a huge effect .
and all of a sudden , and i walked back into this desert to make these images .
the bad description pictures , i 'm not going to show you , but i want to commit for a crime .
girl in the age of four weeks ago , to the end of the month , eventually their parents and their grandchildren came up on earth , on the earth , you would sit on the phone , and you do n't get the phone 's going down with a brand
what you 're doing is a wall of the size of a millimeter .
now , you 're going to have a surgery .
if you do that , if you get your rule , you will come back two weeks .
it was safe to body and soul , and their dignity was their dignity .
this is the beginning of what we call it 's cold .
on the y-axis , it goes on .
the man has to open it .
he has never seen an old woman .
they told him , `` well , not a problem , is n't a problem .
you 're going to take your wallet with you , and then you start hard .
and if you do n't , it 's not bad .
and then you go , and then you put it , and you put it up .
and this is doug engelbart .
it 's worth a third of the girl .
this one had three months ago .
in 2006 , the girl lost his language .
these are the toilets , some in asia .
most of the major leaders are critical .
and when we asked muslims , why did you do this ?
and the final response , we must do that , which is in the koran .
none of it is in the koran , in the opposite .
so , every student is five times a day , just like things like , the creator , is perfect , perfect .
but they do n't seem to believe what they 're going to .
now , they 're using training , which has been created for women , and that 's why you can imagine as a permanent human man , you could n't get women .
but we had now , we had the images of the first three times of this epidemic .
he was telling us his whole album at a conference .
there have been hard for two days long .
but we had our health care center on our site , the highest gates on our side .
and then finally , the great decision for all human rights , for religion , we need to have it .
so the last thing that 's created was this new york .
and if you go to africa and you know , you know , that 's for these people .
and it was inevitable , and we had it in other countries .
short , for example , here 's the best mess , the ceo of the country by the country , that it 's a crime to write and to write that to the city .
we were on the road , and we were using them .
we had a hundred percent of them .
and where we came up , we have only open ears , open arms , and it 's the most exciting , the historical canyon .
and when we wanted to go to the country , said of the great nuclear r company , you know , do you want to look at all the time countries ?
so much of life do n't get you anymore .
he 's right .
i 'm a blogger , and i have to come back to this thing .
and especially , he had an idea .
he said that if you were going to meet the ten commandments of people in the world , and then you can bring it in the world , it 's a dish .
and then -- and i went to the library and i -- like , the editor of the volcano of the glacier .
and when they 're doing the job , his doctor 's professor professor doctor , we got a funeral .
he was telling the idea of being excited , especially when we made it , that we would destroy that .
and that 's what we 're going to do is we 're going to talk about freedom that are helping us
and then he said , i 'm not just going to end up the conference , as we asked him , but i 'm going to take it out .
and that 's what he did .
over decades , at least point , we have our power system .
international policy at the end of their female 's own female body through it .
under the director of the company 's professor of professor , professor doctor .
and everybody 's got it .
a hundred hundred , but the highest in the world .
in the middle of england , the guy has taken in school , and in the rest of europe he 's got to be the most of the owner of it .
so , men who are able to live and death .
but also the other .
on the left of the cold , the dance , my shirt .
the highest in the world .
now , i 'm just going to do a lot about what i 'm doing , and i 'm personally personally .
and then i brought them all .
it started the conference .
and under our sign on the left of the left of the glacier , of egypt .
the danish director of the wild egypt , a new york from wife brothers , and she 's elected , germany .
so much of the subject , islam does n't come up .
we also talked to have the nurses , and they do it in their way , which were terrible to women who were doing them .
and then what they did is show their film , actually .
reality .
the men had broken eyes .
and they moved back in front of times after just two hours after two hours , and they decided to have an apple .
in the meantime , the cameras show , what you decided .
and the most important thing about this , this was the one .
female mammography is a u.s. war against the highest values of islam .
he 's wearing the gun .
we thought , well , the job is done , but it was n't the most fun way .
because the idea of talking about the bible of the woman is more than everybody understood .
that 's why we 've got .
we 've got this up with this conference in this called `` the golden book . ''
and one of them for the world of the world .
and also , because of course , the ceo , the book , he 's got it with a sling .
it will take us out of your hands .
we were in a lot of the countries in many countries in many countries with the highest highest .
and they were talking about this in some of the interest , so they have the book .
but unfortunately , most of the courage are not the courage to let 's say that .
so , you 're not going to be able to talk about the `` vagina of the woman , '' which is
only some have the courage .
they 're at least in the universities .
and sometimes , we 've created some brilliant research that have actually been used in the 1960s about this .
and then it goes down into a little bit .
and these are the individuals .
they 're going to spread it .
but i 'm running out of time .
it 's all sitting on hot rock , and it 's about working on a lot of other ways of this issue .
we need to do it .
but my sisters would be this .
i want to say the great message of the highest world in the world at the end of islam .
do n't you go to your open open , but you 're in the factory .
if there are four million people together , men and women are inspired islamic islamic .
and then i said , with all those of you and the top king of my country up here in front of your tracks .
so , like i 've done this for a while .
unfortunately , this is me last , that would be the supreme king .
but i 'm sure if he 's going on that he 's going to show him .
to help these women .
for the other part of the world , which is the real values of islam , rather than always making it .
terrorists used to be a diplomat .
if i do n't do that , then i may have this thing that happened in the morning .
at least , at least many in the most famous part of the world .
and we could add our muscles out there .
and maybe i still feel like that the young girl did n't need to have a date .
then my life was so right .
and i want to say that everybody who has heard this or has seen .
now , i do n't think that 's what 's already going to be a
we 've got to get into the gulf , but i do n't see it on the stage .
and so , i want to show you my vision of the design .
this is my favorite baby , my home .
and this is in all the way in the name of the name , and it 's always going to be there .
there we go , then in the german .
female tulu is with the koran and the invention of islam .
she 's a blogger and a conductor of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm going to start .
this is what it looked like when you went to germany .
when i pay attention , my mother , my brother and i put it for the first time .
it 's been used taken .
my mom was completely unhappy , because she did n't know why we have now put food food .
the third day , we 've been left .
we got rid of the car , and then again , and then they came up with a cold woman and they just went out against it .
and she was trying to explain , `` why , you can eat .
that 's not uncommon .
it sounds very good .
it 's cheese .
my mom walked up and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my own country , we 've lost the phone course .
i 'm a blogger , and i 'm a blogger .
i was with my mother and my mother from china to germany .
i mean , that 's about this family that i 've talked about today .
but most of all , i 'm going to care about the people who have this opportunity and lead to a success success .
but first of all , i 'm going to tell you where i 'm from .
i 'm a blogger .
in fact , you 're a little bit of water that lives in life from china .
and this region is going to be called by the chinese , which is called the u.s. area .
it 's about 12,000 miles away from germany .
in china , in china , within the last 10 million years , but in indonesia , the largest community community is happening outside china .
and this is that life lives , because we do n't have to suffer in china in china .
hundreds of chinese have been used to become a national school in our own home .
our own partner , texting , is taken out of education education .
in schools and in universities , they are only chinese .
and our religion ca n't get free to it .
so they lose their own culture and identity .
and if someone is smart , and for the right now , you 're going to be able to save the way in a way that 's a long term , or even death
that was the reason why my parents had decided to connect with us .
that 's been taken , and i was back 11 years old .
the picture was taken in front of us before .
we did n't have enough money , and that 's why my father had ever left behind it .
i 'm making a lot of people who have helped us in the workforce .
i 'm making a lot of pictures .
i did n't know what we do first to do our legacy .
i do n't feel like that in front of me when i look at my eyes .
he was big , and we met him with his little plastic in a lot .
the first way it was going to go .
i know that a lot of you have a negative image of family , that people do n't want to be doing business , and they 're not interested in terms of what they 're interested in .
but i do n't think about it as a call , not as a storyteller .
because wal-mart has passed us up .
and he stood at the airport in paris on a party , and it took me all the way up to the last end , and that 's why we were actually going to get through the bow .
and we sat in here , and i remember my mother , sort of , sort of , sort of out of the airport .
do n't you .
we 're out there .
because i had one person in my hand , and there was my photo , but there was a christian name .
i had to come up as a nurse .
and i was doing that at me , and i was doing it in my tracks for me , he had my eyes in my hand .
silence .
marcus .
a long step .
and we finally went out .
in philadelphia , i started to think of a lot of people who were kind of had to help us .
i 'm taking off to the young woman who worked with us in the service .
in a bar with four units per gallon , per capita family families .
at least , children kids .
a bow and a kitchen .
there were strangers faces .
and many different languages .
and we had no privacy .
my mom , my brother and i had to have an ad .
there was done , ready and tea .
now , friends did n't go too , because i 'm going to go , where we were .
but just my favorite therapist 's license in the 1970s knew knew knew .
she knew my story and me turned to me , and she turned to me .
for example , she took me to `` what i did n't do now .
but they were also kind of helped me to kind of german friends .
so i spent my whole lot of research in the classroom .
it was n't just my mom .
in alone with our children , without their husband , and always in the uncertainty , because we 've only had a conversation , and we 've been able to get married .
i 'm very passionate about this , i was very , very sick of the time .
it 's kind of embarrassing , i just have to tell you now , but now i have to tell my story .
i was very lucky , and i could barely kind of focus in a community .
so they took us to the barefoot camp where we went to the first time to normal children .
in normal words , i have children who do n't have to come in a museum .
and i was also used to my father who took me and my brother had to come to me .
we 're going to make it a little bit .
i 've also made a couple of high school who worked with us , because our parents do n't have one disease .
or they just went .
we have always been very happy .
i know how we were getting out there before , and when these guys came up to these people , because , somehow , people looked at us for us , and that was also important to us .
after two years , my father came to germany .
but the problem was that , he 's being taken over the ground for a while , because there 's no room left for him .
i 'm very passionate about the very , very , very , very , very , very , very quickly about china in china , and he made it even for us in the world .
and i was preparing for that time , where i was really happy , because after six years , we 've been able to come to a normal park .
we took a grant for three years , and we had finally been able to build a live with a normal arms and a own kitchen .
and i even had a room .
it was very small , and i had no tea in it , but it was good , i could open my door .
and i 'm glad i do n't have time time , but i did n't have to go through the city without a meal .
i did n't look at me .
there came up with a nurse that has always turned me into the workforce , and it 's still the idea that i can go through the second one that i can get my own record .
first of all , they 're going to kick the gun .
i was so much of the teachers that really believed about me , and i was n't just at the time , i was even going to middle .
and after that , i came up to the camp .
and before i went to the interview , i was playing with my best friend at tedwomen .
it 's an organization , or a project of organized .
but i was n't a good dancer , i just made it because we had had a place where we could just go through .
and we had a little bit that we had able to bring our back in .
and the head of college began to make us feel that we were able to tell our problems to this , and he gave us all the things to all work .
and after that , i came up to open up .
and this is a project that a young people should have received the opportunity to do this .
i 've really been very good , and i 've got to think art is something which i 'm doing .
and when they go from , and they came to a team at us .
he made the film of life on the life of my friends and myself .
and the film won a lot of oil .
we realized that the people were interested in our history .
he was a very special feeling , because we never had experienced that people were listening to us .
and that was the moment i thought , okay .
i do n't want to leave anymore .
i want to make something out of my life .
a treaty of philadelphia , a department of activist school , came to me with an idea of a led to a factory factory .
but since i had been totally locked up in the jungle of that night , i 'd become an apartment for a little bit , and the title was actually one until four .
so i was really right .
i was playing with .
and the great thing is that , after a series of two , two , of course , you know , i 'm going to get around .
and i was asked , if i had to make interest in my own time .
i was like , really , great .
i do n't move .
and i was doing for the jet store now , and now i went back to some of my own , and i had one of my favorite camera , and one of my favorite computer talks about a little bit of a play in which i was also offered for the
and i 've actually won it .
now , i 've been working on college for the new york city and the film of the film at the third of the film , and i 'm a blogger of college .
and all of that would have been not possible for me if not any individual or organizations like me , or how did projects like they were good for me .
they 've taken me in my mind , and they 've given me a lot of what i can do my place in the society .
and that 's what i 'm going to do now .
each of you have the opportunity to get people like me to help and find your life or find your place in society .
because , people come out of thousands of thousands of cigarettes , each of them , and each of them have a big potential .
they have made a great deal with great weapons , there 's lots of thousands of thousands of boxes .
and with that ambition , it could be a big cause of germany for germany and for every single one .
and i could actually tell a thousand of what you can do , but because i do n't have the more time sitting there for a minute , and then let me give you a pencil .
do you picture your cell phone , you ca n't tell me that you ca n't have a code .
take the code , and then they come to the site of a lot of what they can do .
and that would help us very well .
now , i 've already been interested in love for you , and we 're going to see it outside .
and let 's add the code .
i do n't know .
many , many of you do n't have in your hand .
are you so much , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
do n't .
first time , you 've got a nasty joint accent .
so , let me share with you .
my name is eric .
my journalism is write a little bit easier than that .
i come from school , that 's in bangladesh .
now , i 'm afraid i 'm really going to be in love to be here today , is really beautiful .
i 'm going to throw it every time .
and that 's not a phrase . that 's a feeling .
yes , yes , unlike another , i 'm not here today to talk to you about something .
i do n't know what .
but it 's like i write writing writing in my games and i give it a little bit about this , and most of a sudden you are called or you 're going to be run out of what you 're doing , or you 're going , or you 're
yeah , and i was asked for myself to show up a couple of slides , and we put all the program up .
and that 's what i 'm doing here now .
yes .
i start with a joke .
two , two .
so that 's one of the two english guys , so i do n't make you free , but so she 's kind of funny at a funny thing , and they 're going to make a dance of dance 's dance .
`` the other thing . ''
you do n't want to make the last thing about a little bit
so here we have the problem .
the first text is a little baby i wrote about .
i said that at the time that i was able to do that i was part of what 's called .
it 's called the title .
and yes , she did n't understand that .
as your head in my mind was the rest of my head .
my leg was also under my left leg outside the ceiling .
my leg was long through the ceiling .
it 's about your head up on my head , the rest of your leg under the ceiling , my leg under your ceiling , your leg outside of the ceiling .
that 's when i think about my leg .
it was very embarrassing .
the next couple of the text , i also saw a person who had a lot of it .
and it was my death .
we did n't have any more of them .
my grandfather grandfather was to work with a job .
as a child , he 's filled with love of love .
i 'm just like that .
yes , even more silly text .
it 's not going to be the case .
jesus is the only shot on top of the ship .
but where was pregnant ? he was supposed to save me to that ?
now , guess , yes ?
did i have my fortune already ?
close text .
the next text is a little bit longer .
he 's going to make it a day .
so for writing .
it goes faster .
it 's the beginning of a novel , which i 'm going to call `` some of the other . ''
ah , it 's about commercial guys , so the founder of a guy who 's still holding the hair and do a little bit .
but i 'm afraid , but i 'm going back to this point of what i 'm going to .
because i do n't know the hair .
one 1 .
if i get my head down my head .
that 's what empty like that , which he 's trying to try .
yeah , i did n't come .
it 's very hard for hours .
the next text is a little bit .
most people do n't understand .
i 'm also hard for myself .
and that 's the game i like to share with my passion and with my speech .
i 've been doing that for me .
and yeah , we come to those things .
it 's called the title .
it 's a little bit strange thing .
this is what 's called what 's called , which i 've ever done .
we can do that .
yes , we go ahead .
we can see that .
we 're going .
i do n't know .
but i can .
i can do so .
i 'm not not sure .
yeah , i did n't understand that .
no idea .
yes , yes , i 'm out of .
i 'm always saying , either or no .
the next piece is also what 's going to do with text .
it 's kind of a little bit of a mess .
i 've been doing it for insects .
very simple .
yes , even more silly text .
it 's a little paper .
and i think it 's always cool when i 'm going to show up and make three of you say .
my text leaves us , all good things are cool .
so , if you do n't buy it so , it 's so
we do n't have to run off .
so you have to have , you 've got to go , and you 're going to get around and you 're going and get it all the way , and you know , that 's
well , there 's a great moment moment .
yes , even more polite , this is another one other .
and i think it 's always cool when i do that , we can make all of the way of make this kind of thing like this , we 're going to try all of this .
that 's exactly what the wind is doing .
the text are called the title and the question .
yes .
it 's fun to you .
the text text is just one sentence .
i write it like this little bit .
and this is a piece of a piece of magic .
it 's written with written written .
marcus , marcus ?
yeah , yeah .
it 's fun to you .
yes , we 're going to have a little sentence .
it 's written in taiwan .
it 's a very long sentence .
i just think it 's impossible impossible to explain in the game and explain that is the point .
here , another text .
this day , this is a ring .
it 's the title of text .
this day is a shepherd and he knows it .
it has already known before i 've given it .
he made me cry in front of it , and then he would let me go .
i can still tell him later .
i made him the joy .
and it was like when it went to all of all of these other days , and i fell down again .
now , in a liberal demonstration on your face ?
and it 's not going to have that anymore that i 'm going to run .
and i should later later , but it 's not a day of a day .
hope 's hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
now , what happened to einstein einstein , was n't he liked ?
i wish .
so .
the letter sounds like the cow .
that 's the fun thing .
yes , the next text that she did was writing a paper .
it 's more than political .
so , not just funny things .
i also write very political things .
and i 'm often wondered where i 'm dancing .
and , yeah , i 've got one of these guys .
it 's called the title of the title .
my father came to me , and then in my mother and i would look .
yes .
if we got it .
thank you for the sound .
yes , in this case , i do like a little bit of advertising .
i ca n't do business or do that , so i still have to do this .
and that 's when i do n't fall in myself , and i also do myself in one of them , and i also do a call out of coffee in
can i like to come back .
and yes , i 'm singing ' , i 'm actually doing some research .
and , yes .
i just want to say that .
it goes on the program .
there 's no advertising .
this is a little advertising i 've written about .
feet .
rich vitamin d .
so the cat .
vitamin chimpanzee .
very funny .
i want to write a joke about your friend 's friend , but it was just flat .
yeah , it 's not my favorite calendar .
now , when you 've got a company that you 've got to go to college , the department of warcraft , you 've got to make a look at the
yes .
thank you for listening .
you were great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me just start with a quick question .
why do you want to do that ?
i mean , everybody , if you should ask , it should be used to ask whether or at least at some point , you could imagine society .
and the answer is quite clear .
now we already know that the life rate that 's the only time that 's the only thing that 's only is used to be about 85 percent is now .
that is , you have to have any effect , you 've got the impact on this .
why do n't we know that ?
why are we going to come from mr. news out of what 's going on to the part of each other ?
you all remember a few years ago .
it was fat .
and you thought that if you eat food from food , we 're going to be all going to be healthy .
and what went up at the tower of bp 's floating , has covered with a bunch of power in america , and what 's nothing about that the americans are going to be a year .
you said , `` oh , no .
but not that fat .
these are the instructions .
and then it turns out to be like the head of the ladder , which has taken it over and so forth .
so it 's going to come back and quickly , and it 's going to move to the new trajectory by it .
how do all the time ?
well , the reason is , for my sake , at least , is that we 're going to launch through the open state model of scientific music .
so , for example , it 's here .
you know that , you know .
now , filmmaker published a lot of design created a new machine .
the top of the top of the department of the library department for the next year .
jay took seven years for seven years to another one .
then it died .
or this lady here .
geoffrey chen .
the oldest man ever lived on earth .
fourteen years of old became .
now , i know there are some people who say , you know , you know , you ca n't find your pants .
and archie 's actually become a bust .
and they stopped at home to sleep at home , but at the end of time again , at the end of them , he was trying to follow and stop for free .
they have died with it .
what does that tell us ?
not that groups are healthy .
but it tells us that success is a very complicated thing , and that we 're going to set up a lot of we need to do a simple basis of what we call simple engineering systems and we have to ask simple questions .
so , very simple question , and a very simple one , which is women in different countries , women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it now .
so , that 's what 's most of the food , which is made up in the male male .
and there 's actually a simple evidence that it 's going to make men as old as women .
now , everybody can think of yourself as well as that 's a binary .
success is a real country .
but there 's even better hustles , no fear .
in general , we 're going to have to fix ourselves around with optimism .
it sounds complicated , but it 's just not to hide .
so there 's someone who makes me take an underdog and ask me , what do they do ? how do they do differently or how much it was that they were so old ?
ah .
and the university has taken out of every day every day .
that 's the secret of your son , right ?
the only thing that 's not going to do is n't the ten .
or , you know , you 've got to sleep , and you know it would n't be older .
even more often , statistics are not always fragile .
for example , there 's very hard statistics , which shows that people who are actually going to come back in school , people who do n't do that .
so .
it 's gone .
is that what you have about ?
no .
it 's because people just have enough money in their pocket to care about their age and the neurological conditions .
if i , one group of a sudden for food , and that group will be given to 20 percent longer than the kidney age that you could n't get , but otherwise that 's probably the same thing that 's before , then , you know , i 'm actually going to
and in fact , they 've been done .
have to tell you , but now i 'm very passionate about what i do , but what i 'm talking about is that this is a living way of living alive .
and this works for the most complex organisms .
for example , in bacteria .
you 're looking at a little bit of bacteria .
when we get rid of it , in the wild line , we 've never been able to keep life out there .
the same is true of sports , flying flies , and has recently it only about two years ago in america in the united states , that even for monkeys .
it 's not about being thin .
it also works at the heart of the heart kitchen .
and this is another experiment in the united states .
what did you do here ?
and you 've got to do it , and it has been designed with a so-called company , and then it 's a media diet where they 've been so many of them back here and night .
and who said , these are small , and you 've got a good thing to do , and you 've got to do well , and you 've got very bad grades .
now , you 've taken a little bit of jazz animation , and it has actually been the same same number of energy back that it was n't taken away .
they do n't have anything eating there for nothing to eat twice as much .
and this is now , both and healthy , and it does n't have a luxury .
and even though , despite both of them have been sold .
both have a lot of it .
it 's a sick and it 's going to have the other healthy .
what 's happening here ?
it 's going to be a process called model , or it 's up .
when they grow organisms , or cells , or cells , they start to enter the activity of the organism , in the speed of the cell , or creating manufacturing parts of time to make it again .
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
you can see , how do they do in the cell , they do themselves as well , for example , that during the old age .
and then the owner of that , when you 're going to be able to do the components and have the cell as energy .
it will only be the case that in the age of light in the age .
that 's the game of the game dance , or at the end of a lot of a lot .
so , in order to bring it up , it 's a life of different organisms .
and it 's probably to say that it also works in humans .
and what we learn is that they do n't just like in a high school company that day of malnutrition should have to run up with them .
no .
but , you should say , if you 're hungry , you know , maybe you 're going to open up .
do you care about your hunger as a friend .
and that makes sense .
in fact , nine nine percent of the human history has ever been wondering if he had died .
right , it 's been launched .
we do go to the mall when we 're hungry .
and that is certainly against biology .
now , of course , we do n't know , and this is already in the bible , in the bible mark , and the head of grass , but the meat is weak .
the prison looks very different .
and here 's already made by 12,000 farms in a south of eden .
the three mate here is good for the food , and then they 'll use .
and that 's kind of what 's going to be doing .
so , we 've come to search for us to make the molecular response of the ocean in physical life .
this could be interesting for people to be interesting , not in a very good one , but they do n't take their own .
and it might allow us to be more of the world 's safe life .
so the question is , can we have the toothbrush , the cloud , the state of the state , even though we eat ?
and we have a lot of hundred hundred , we have been called a thousand , natural movement .
we 've found that what is found , that 's called a bird .
it 's an important thing that happens in all of these organisms , but also in all of the organisms that we do n't have less .
in the skin , it 's on the street .
people have already lost less than in the skin than they are in .
and if we 're going to put in human cells , for example , you see this .
so this is something like this cell .
it 's the nest , we 're putting a lot on it , and we 're going to see a lot of thousands of thousands of these little windows in each cell , which is the texture that 's during this event .
so , you know , if you want to make a look look like that
and this works in different organisms .
so here 's an example of what i 'm doing .
so , we have found , `` what 's bizarre , '' is that they have the molecular game of a game set .
life because it 's a longer longer .
and the answer is again , you 're going to see here 's a typical typical building of a factory .
it 's simple .
now , after christmas days , all dead dead died in the days is about half dead days .
when we get into the water , here in the brain , it 's going to be older and better .
we also know that human cells , which we 've heard about `` 25,000 '' in a culture , about three times as long as we do it with them .
and the latest research is , even though , even though the life is dominated by all of these channels is born .
and it 's not just life , it 's the mosquito .
those of them are clear .
so , you know .
now , you know , you do n't want all know where 's going on ?
as the name said , it has been found in the forest because it 's very high place .
but i can also encourage them , even in the green green green of green fluorescent bottles , and a product that 's a product in japan , in japan , in japan , that 's so dear , it 's a lot of
and we said , `` how do you make your work by being able to do it by making it work ?
what you have to know is that the common set of all of these disorders is that when it comes in the brain is that during the process of the brain , it 's in the brain
and we 've done experiments in that .
you 're going to wonder , we 've done these animals .
however , however , they 're also going to be when they 're old .
they have more roots in the brain when they 're old .
and the extraordinary effects that are kind of similar to memory , are very similar to people .
now , you 're asking yourself , what the hell does the memory of ant flies ?
so this is the experiment that we 've done in common with video tools at the university of berlin .
you can take a hundred million times , and you put them in one of those who you love .
sebastian .
and let 's go through that in this room .
and then you take the same fly , you can put them in the next and you give it to other people that you love .
we 're going to enjoy them doing this , but while they 're singing , they 're dancing .
morton bast .
then you take the same same , you can do this in here .
you 'll go down here , you look down here , you see .
and if you 're here down here , they 'll give you one of the page and on your other side .
where do they go ?
yeah .
it 's a loss of war .
except the two .
these are the bears .
or , say , they have character .
i love my pants , and i do n't ask it , and i do n't like it .
okay .
but it 's a form of what 's happening with age .
not only fly .
and we were able to get the bones that fly up to a team of building on a board , and we were able to bring them back .
and the geese that were in the brain were used again .
that is , that 's not only against the value , but it 's also against mental diseases .
and that 's important , because we do n't want to have to be the emergency condition of a hospital .
it does n't make sense that 's the time of the ladder .
and i do n't want to leave that without giving you a couple of security argument that we 're going to die .
and then they were dancing .
it 's not about the weight that you do .
there are , by the way , at the time , it 's got a group of people who eat a day and eat a day .
this is what 's called wired , and it 's called the roofs of the very sensitive ones , and it 's called roots .
and they do it very well .
that is , it 's one-dimensional .
it turns out .
it 's not about conventional complex , it does n't seem to be dangerous .
it 's really about design .
you know , you know , you 've got this open , you know , think about diabetes , even if you are .
and you also know that sugar can reduce the growth of tumors .
and this is where they 're looking at , which is a little bit off .
it 's all dead .
we 're going to take a lot of tons of genetic rich .
you can create a universal effect .
there 's just one example that works in almost all organisms .
eat them vegetables and vegetables .
she had to get the head of too much equipment , or from a party .
now , you know that can -- and you can use cancer cancer .
it does n't mean under vitamin d .
we 're going to be here here today , because vitamin d is going to move through sunlight on the skin .
you can tell at least three times a week , that 's a little bit .
in 1980 , if you look at what you 're going to do , they 're going to take 10 to six to six years
now , you 're going to do it in time , at times , that 's pain .
so , the impact of integrity and blood pressure is the life of life .
because life is almost as long as women .
`` oops , scott , life is more than an egg .
life 's more than being a designer .
but more life is still more than a chemist .
only , they 're dying to be considered as a designer .
what is that ?
people think that 's what 's going to do with a problem .
it 's a way , it 's very simple .
now , if i 'm going to open a little bit on the window here , i 'm going to make it up with a cold .
and what 's probably happening is probably in your mind .
you have run down , you know , you 're being replaced by definition of circumstances .
that 's why it does n't seem to change in particular .
if you have a dangerous partner , or a family family is associated with organic .
they do n't want to live in a much street street .
now , they 're going to do now think about the same
but this has done to do nothing .
it 's about efficiency .
you can measure weight at a much lower street road in the road , and the more you use it in blood .
and that , when he says , i 've made a lot of it .
i 'm already going to sleep in love and the sound does n't matter .
right ?
it 's still more violent in the blood , and it 's bad .
climate change should be ignored because of course .
now we already know that liberals have a very good negative effects .
in fact , it can drive down to it .
and we do n't know that the deal of the time , and the internet is against human capital .
we also knew that , by the way , we 've been working with a lot of partners and so forth .
no no sense .
several studies shows that new chocolate can continue to make toast .
and just recently , a wonderful study showed that we 've shown that , if you can get a very nice image of your day , you can get the basics of a bomb at the level of a ship .
similarly , so , you know , you 're talking about coffee here , but that 's the thing , but
there are studies that are showing this , there 's studies that do n't show this .
and what 's clear is that , in a traditional artist , it 's a lot of their wealth .
and coffee , by the way , a good will work is because he does n't take care of how we 're going to start using a synthetic process of paris .
so , very beautiful and inspiring study for thousands of people , for thousands of thousands of people , have been studied shown that people , every day , they were eating 24 percent .
it 's a massive value for a comic study .
and this is true for sports , desires , gobble , dance , open , open , open .
now , not but for example , you know , you know , that 's kind of , you
they just give up by saying , `` okay ? ''
but that 's actually not .
so this is n't going to be a little bit .
the next thing is a little bit .
if you took the heat off much of the animal protein , you know , of course , of meat , but just when you 're between the age and the age of years old .
so , very nice new study , what it shows is that , if you can find in this area of a lot of organic protein , you just want to make your breath as much as you if you were a powerful one .
that 's not true for the time , when there are proteins proteins , and it does n't mean if you do n't have kids , or you know , who have states that need a plant , and it 's not for sale and those who want it to
in general , they succeeded .
whatever you do , you 've heard that , as you know , you know , thomas , who said , he said , `` the rejection , '' and the english will hold the funders of health .
it 's all in the hospital 's office .
and this is the gentleman of mr. jefferson who has taken around this continent , and he 's served in his age .
he 's coming from my home from family 's desk 's not sick .
and he 's very good .
he 's not just one thing that he 's not going to be in a hospital , where there 's a lot of a lot of healthy healthy .
and he took about what i proposed , which i told you today .
we should not solve the same thing in all the same time technology .
in fact , that the failure of the department of the system had a sense of material , but it 's going to be a social level , and then finally , a computer cycle .
you 're treating the old people , and it could be one of the most profound mistakes of our culture .
now , i wrote the great novel of a year before his death .
the brothers mate .
a piece of work , at a work that is called , the french dictator .
thank you for your attention .
i want to start with one question that i 'm going to do .
one question , where no one has to pay attention , is because it 's a little bit out who of you is dead ?
so , it 's very small .
less than i thought .
but it 's probably the reasons why they did n't come , the people who would do it for themselves .
a lot of people will bring up and say , and they think , and think of that as well .
it 's actually not the case .
so , what will see is a phenomenon of being a phenomenon of being alone than being alone .
maybe it 's also because you did n't come up with the question of the question .
do you feel like yourself or you 're hungry ?
you can feel feeling like being caught .
and you can feel like it without yourself in a moment .
now , luckily has a lot to do with anything .
now , again , this is what 's going to be here at now here , and it 's got to become a universal signal
and so , of course , in terms of knowledge , and hope is going to go into
it takes time .
and it 's not nobody here in the few seconds i 've given you .
now , sylvia 's need to do that .
it takes time to be aware of what you 're going to be aware of .
and it takes also a practice to talk about this .
and we do n't have to do that kind of thing .
how we do n't have the language yet we have signs of ourselves in ourselves when we 're hungry ?
so , there 's a good one of these two , which i 'm always now .
one part of humanity , i think you 're at the beginning of birds .
from birth to death , it 's actually just smiling .
there are few moments in life where you can do that .
so these people often go to and get their day .
i do n't have the same time , so she 's so her .
and then there 's people who maybe have n't been there who say everything is connected to everything .
i do n't really know it , so i 'm just part of the great universe .
and there 's the great group that i 'm going to be like to look like this .
i think , okay , today i am , and the next day , oh , it 's all related to you .
if we think about compassion , we are always at the first thing that 's very big .
the intelligence of the citizen 's disease , the censorship of happiness in an education .
but this is going to be about these `` many , '' and i do n't talk about it today , but i want to talk about the little one that i 'm going to be looking at you , where you can see it in such a theater
i do n't want to talk about a hundred and a half of the ladder .
now , `` now , at other point , we often do n't have very hard to look at ourselves at the end of ourselves .
so , the economist 's suspended book has made a few photos that i want to show .
how easily it 's always us to look at other aspects .
we do n't all know if these people feel at that moment .
but if you do n't know that , you know , the moment you have to think of this as an event where you think , all of you talk to each other , you only have lost something in the corner and not you have to .
and all of a sudden , you know , you know , all of a sudden
maybe some of you have experienced this already .
what you do is when you do it , you can see the cell phone out of a lot , that 's what you 've been doing in a very strange view now , which is what you 're doing on the cell phone , you know ,
clearly , if you look at the screen .
now , what we do n't now do here .
yes , and then there 's the description , the one time in front of you are going to hear the basics of a nigerian website at a long stage with hundreds of verbs , and you put something on the hope that you do n't hear your text .
these are the ones you see from the outside .
we can tell other people .
but i 'm sure i 'm here in the room there are people in the room who live out of birth , who 've spent all of their lives in the entire life of the same way that they 've been trying to do this .
and there 's also people who are in this room because they need to be a different person , because of their death or because of a sudden .
it does n't mean anything that many people , even people , they 're connected to them , so they 're feeling they 're feeling .
and there are people who have n't been able to be able to lose themselves to themselves , and they 're so lonely .
i 'm calling the digital analogy .
and so , `` i 'm going to give you the latest principles .
so , the traditional consensus is familiar with us .
these are the people who are interested in their opinion , they think they are faced in social terms .
it 's just relatively relatively .
there 's not a number number when someone has n't enough human race , when not .
and the old people are doing it .
it 's the new form of humor .
but since then , we all live in cities with lots of people on facebook , or through twitter , or facebook , that digital become increasingly bigger .
you can be able to be with hundreds of people without having to be connected .
it 's more sensitive to the sum of human relationships , which is , of course , it 's at the digital layer of the quality of relationships .
the two forms of the brain are very often against each other .
and that 's also because of the new yorker calls a little bit old .
so , whereas the digital drone are all fine , fine , for both , not in their own .
it turns out that is that the digital root of the future is even more likely to communicate , to connect .
i do n't know if you 're going to be able to do that feeling that will be affected by what we 're going to be very similar , even the other call .
or whether you find a new term .
but these are also the problems of the generation generation .
so much bigger than the threat itself is fear and from that fear of perspective , people will be a little bit to do .
and , you know , the great bike , also a little person who has written a wonderful album .
in what they call , what humans do everything to be alone .
they 're building them , they 're dead kids who then are dead and live .
but the department of it was n't just about fear of law , which is money .
go ahead .
things like that .
so the process of the process , it 's because of course , because it 's at least much more likely to be able to do the objects that you 've had .
problem is just that it 's very easy to do it , and it 's going to happen in this case against the science .
so we 've got to do new things to do new things .
i 've been watching an advertising for a new house .
and it 's quite moving away from a mobile communication that 's the kind of fun .
what do you have to do in your house , you do n't know that , but it seems obvious .
so now it 's nothing to do with the standard of life , and there 's nothing to do that instead .
now , tori wrote a wonderful poem , and there 's a picture of the worst , but the worst one , the worst is the most famous one .
hand on your heart , who does n't know that ?
in one relationship to be able to do or watching the other and feel very happy to feel bad , white and ask the question who is this person ?
did i do anything to do with this ?
a study is that the women who are women around the road , die , with children , feel .
you ca n't , because i do n't know what i 've been invented in the study themselves as many times , i told them .
but now , it 's mostly completely , because it 's at decades , and the response is always in the response , that the people in front of me .
now , that 's kind of a way , that 's kind of a lot of sense , it 's almost a
now , the dark thing to do is that we 're going to be a little bit , and yet , we do n't
just talk very little bit about the humor of sex .
it probably has experienced everybody .
yet , while you 've got to think about it , suddenly , what do you do here ?
who is that person in my bed ?
so , again , this is a form of not necessarily that we do n't necessarily have to deal with the quality of it .
we do n't have to deal with the quality of relationship .
she 's just there .
we do n't just talk about it , because we do n't .
we 're not talking about it in the workforce .
so in the workforce , our ignorance is as well as we think .
i stood up in front of these bike , and i noticed a group of five pounds , better , three , three , and two fingers .
the two men have a conversation that both women have in the workforce .
and in between the state of a sudden , something happens with the water in a hand 's hand .
i mean , i do n't have to go through the scene of this one on the stage so that it 's a kind of kind of like that you 've been able to look at this kind of random that all the time you 've ever been able to do
it 's the description of the ipad .
but it 's also the description of the ipad .
we all know that i 'm going to see , or i see here , you know , i 'm also going to give you your life on your life . ''
in denmark , in tokyo , in the video , in the buddhist , often , that 's often not knowing what they 're actually making .
where they are , where they wake up .
so , again , this is a form of not being talking about it .
but it 's just how it 's also been able to become the best thing as a storyteller .
here 's a little bit here .
and i asked a post that he was called `` a farmer , and he said , `` it 's kind of thing , you ca n't imagine it .
a date was alone in the library .
so that 's what he does himself for itself .
and then two months later , he 's also obsolete .
it 's never going alone .
it 's always interacting with other feelings .
she has beautiful look at it , and she 's got very smooth .
we know the very bad ones .
fear , despair of despair and of the wisdom .
but we should also forget the good quo .
so the freedom of freedom is the desire to do that .
so this is what i 'm going to look at you , look at the scale .
it 's coming in and live like the inside of the tree .
do n't let them go and do n't do it by you .
because there 's something much worse than the most , and that 's the dna , you know , the only way you 're going to see when you feel nothing .
it 's an part of life .
since i 've worked so hard about this , since i 've worked so hard for me two things .
for one in my mind , i did n't call the `` i thought i 've ever got to hold on somebody . he ca n't get it because i do n't feel like it , i do n't feel like it , i do n't know .
it 's been since , since i 've got the privilege of my life in my life .
that 's what it 's like to do with the maggots that you do .
i 've become the free way .
people come and go away , they 're not going to go down immediately if they can come from a random situation , or could n't have a knowledge .
as a child , i found incredibly incredibly depressed .
they ca n't just talk to any kind of music without having a conversation .
whether or whether you do or in the economy .
every time it 's an extraordinary conversation .
when i was a kid , i thought it was called .
as a young person , i 've been making it incredibly open to have this openness .
but first of all , i 've been working on with me as well , at least very moving at me one way , and i would also open up to it .
you 'll see it 's going to be ready for the next .
thank you very much .
yeah , thank you .
i 've done here three here .
a department of a helmet and a shower .
and now , i mean , you know , if you were one of the time , if you were , then , if you were one of the weight
most of them would decide for that .
and that 's a good idea .
and why ?
because we 're going to deal with the greatest economic impact .
in health , we do something differently .
we 're going to deal with that with the biggest content of eight , and we decide for others .
we decide for example , for the sake and for the future .
but large , very big , very hard .
for me , it 's not so valuable .
or we 're going to decide for us .
it 's for diet .
but also , very large , still , very big effort .
for me , not so valuable .
and i want to share with you today about how it 's going to make the greatest effort out of the largest workforce .
if you 're dealing with health and health , you do n't want to take a place .
and the subject is , of course .
and the theme of that happened , in germany , it was n't a matter of time , and it 's about the time .
and then the number of smallpox went in germany .
and i was wondering , what was going on in this ?
so why was that so suddenly suddenly go up ?
and then what i did was i 've been doing research , and i 've also become a bust .
because it was n't exactly years .
what was there ?
and that came to germany .
and we 're always going to always get more and more and more and more
and i kept on .
he comes from going to germany .
and that 's going to be safe .
and in the years of the year , the curve takes a curve .
and what about germany ?
you 're going to run and dancing and dancing and sweat , and how that 's all about .
and we 're always going to always get more and more and more and more
well , then one thing i did was one .
because it was clear .
expensive power is fat .
and of course , `` now , i do n't have here to tell you that there is apple .
because that 's not true .
but one thing we 've shown in common .
the dolphins are always in new classes -- and they have not been able to become better and healthier .
so what about then ?
diet ?
and there 's a great research study in the states .
and the problem with economic power .
and they put them in the open department .
and then they just wanted to look at what was going on ?
and you 've seen that people are actually less but less but less fat , but people are still less calories , but still still .
and that was embarrassing .
and that 's why they called it .
we can explain that ?
so you have to look at your body like the body force .
so we 've got here here like this .
and on the one hand , there 's a nest , and we 're going to do the whole light on it , and that 's going to be there .
and here 's the energy of energy that is as electricity .
now , if we 're still going to do more here in our power power than we do on the other side , the energy in power and makes it power .
the human body does n't just matter .
it can take energy .
and it 's in form of fat .
our greatest ones , and they 're dancing .
but what happens is that if we do n't have less than we 've heard , energy , and yet the energy , the energy , it 's just one thing .
it has increased dramatically .
there is no life going to be here .
we 're just mobile .
and that 's what happened .
our grandparents , at the end of us , are going to go up to the foot .
and we 're going to come to look at the last two miles , and those are the positive things .
there are studies that are coming from five to two feet .
so , i 'm going to tell you a little bit about my friend 's friend .
would you give me away ?
hi , if you have two degrees ?
girl 's americans .
he 's shy , he 's not going to talk a lot .
and he was at the time at this point , and i 'm sitting there .
he 's this typical of chocolate , and he 's wired and he 's got a seat in his hand .
and harry sex always less and less and less and more and more of a sudden , and yet it 's always and more and more .
why ?
because jesus is just sitting .
and i looked at a time , and i looked like a lot of movement worked like this , and i put him in my head back into the pocket , and i was again again .
and there 's a thousand steps .
so that was the distance , this guy had walked in the middle of the department of the car , where of a little bit of coffee , and then they back back back .
and he came to a thousand .
that 's called david , a day of 10 minutes on his legs .
you know , six hours , and a half minutes of bush , or was french .
this is a condition of disease .
and harry 's not going to be lost because he 's too much food because the long one he 's still at the same time , but it 's not going to always feel more and more and the energy .
and first of all , the energy , as you see here , at its desk .
but energy , you know , you ca n't get there .
at least point back back into the blood .
and also , they 're active , and they 're quiet , and they 're quiet at his home .
so , the blood vessels .
so when your energy goes back into the blood , then you will speak to the doctors , and you 'll talk , and you get high off high .
and that chip , which is basically like this , and it 's got all over small holes everywhere .
and a good thing is that all of the fat is walking around , and this is now on those little things that we 're talking about , and we 're talking about them , or dry .
and now it 's got free heart right under pressure , because now it 's got to blood blood through these tissues , and we 're talking to speak .
and when that truck goes into that car , it does force in the body .
and when that 's on the heart , it 's called your heart heart .
and when that happens , we call it the apple .
and also in germany , every second of heart has been heart , and tuberculosis .
that means , in germany , at least in germany , at least one second .
and so luckily , so it 's not that hard because it 's not so sick because it does n't use a vacuum but it 's not because it 's not moving at all .
and if you do n't know that , then you look at the wrong spot .
for example , on a scale .
i 've heard two degrees . yesterday , i 'm going to run to the center of london , and when we 're going to open open laden , right ?
and if any of the book is kind of an inch thick , and we 're going to get this up here , we would have to have another foot high park high park .
and i 've been all of you for all of you .
and there is , and this is really important if you keep more energy than you use more food than you use it .
and if you do n't use less energy , then you use them .
this is amazing .
but why do we need to do that ?
that 's just one thing .
now , the need of course , of course , is no help .
because why does a feed to a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet and it does n't live .
what is the role of those things that we 're going to do about three weeks , and this is five weeks away when we 're waiting for that , to our normal lives .
what 's going on , after five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
but there 's nothing that goes back and again , and it again , and it 's a process that we do n't have what we 've done .
so , you 're going to be able to look at every new diet in every new diet , where you want to go and do that in your daily life .
yes , or no ?
and then , if you go .
and if they do n't just keep it .
because if there 's nothing out at the end of it , it 's very painful .
these are the concepts that are about whether we 're sick or healthy .
these are the bad materials that make us sick .
and these are the good things that make us healthy .
and when peter looked in the mirror , he looks like the result of his everyday life .
when you look in the mirror , then he 's looking inside his everyday habits .
and when you look in the mirror and be honest , then he can see where he 's gone .
because if it 's more bad than good as good , it 's just in the same way .
and when you go in the direction of the direction of the future of health , then you have to keep your dreams immediately .
it just does n't just need to be more good than bad than bad .
and a biologist , a great example , is a great example of what the human is actually an amazing animal .
so , brian , there 's been able to move away out of your everyday life by using any way through your car , using your car cells using it .
and at night , he 's standing on the couch , and it needs to be able to get a difference .
so he goes into his apartment in his little pocket there , and it 's going to be there , and then it 's like , sort of , like this , you 're going to be able to a band , so you can kind of painting , so he
and my sisters would have felt like it .
he was a farmer , and he would n't have that .
that would have said , `` well , it 's not for people .
and somehow he 's right .
why do we have to do the same thing in our four times more than what we have in the classroom classroom ?
now , we 've had to deal with this year , make two hours per day .
but that 's a little bit easier to find that wherever we lost it .
in life .
and that 's why , i 'm going to show you today to a point of being called today .
maybe you know , they also know the situation , and you 're just going to go quickly quickly for you to go and do n't expect them in the first place .
and what you see is , like , you know , you 've got the privilege of that .
we want to look at the same time .
we make our toes so that we have the basics .
we plan our whole life of life , that we have the most advanced opportunity , but this is not where we are .
but in a very different direction .
that 's why , you know , you 've got to get your ass right now , and you can see the movement where it 's going on .
i 'd like to take up for example .
and i 'm the only one as high and down and down and up and down and down and down and everybody else .
but if i 've already been , i 've been , but the time for me .
then , in fact , i 'm the movement which is just like this .
and when it comes to the wild , i do n't give minutes , say , `` i am . ''
take steps steps .
this is about three times 10 minutes .
and if we 're taking off steps , if you walk up every day , you 'll take a little bit more steps more than that , you know , at the end of that day , 12 times does n't fit in your body .
it may seem little sound .
but as a chemist , when a service , the days of the year , we 're going to talk about four times five pounds .
we do n't have in our body .
and you give me to me , but i 'm always scared .
the americans are crazy , they 're doing something like this .
this is a ring from five pounds of fat .
i think that 's about four pounds .
so you see what happens to these little steps .
and if that 's the effect of this information , what do you mean when you really live in a life .
and that 's what they 're going to take place to every day in their daily life .
once you get at 12,000 steps per day , they 're going to spend virtually all of you .
and if you think about it and time , you 're going to do this for the top .
and then they 're next to the olympics again .
then they become faster and stronger .
but they do n't make their health anymore anymore .
so you do n't make your health on your head and your time .
because the most important thing they do is they make it every day as a living .
and i chose for an active system .
and for me , it 's more than a living for me , for me , it 's a life that is based on a clear decision in life and for myself .
because i think it does n't have to do what we need to do .
but health is doing what we want to do .
and that 's why , that 's why , i 'm just an idea for you .
now , please , please , just for the best .
and yet , you know what it is .
step forward .
thank you very much .
how does it have been an leonardo here in india , could actually work so incredible , and the world in the world of other eyes .
and how much more of the things that happened at the time that was a while just bizarre , was n't it ?
could we do this today ?
is that maybe what 's going to do with education ?
and how can we do that force and freedom for our future ?
so , let 's start with that question , what do we really mean about innovation ?
yeah .
now the technology of research research and development has even been the case of the federal government in the government 's called the federal government .
so , you get me right .
that 's all great .
and we can be very proud about being proud and be grateful that we 're in love with such a lot of our own areas that we have always been anywhere in the world that we want to do it .
we 've created an extraordinary alternative of wealth .
but what about the future ?
what challenges are there to be society as a society ?
and who 's going to do , because the great economic and social challenges ?
so it seems to be kind of being a bit of a way .
it 's a kind of a myth .
so the economy of this is a great challenge because of the entrepreneurs , then the great effort we are then productivity .
and the world makes the world better want to find the world in the wild organizations , and both like , and then the need , then what the companies do , of course , is to reduce the demands of the golden economy .
at least , at least level .
but who says , is that we 've got to look at this as the number of species .
how would it be ? if , what if we do our own social media and cultural dimension ?
now , when technology are innovations , what are cultural innovation ,
so , when economic species , at the same time , social innovation ?
so if you want to think about it , and how do you deal with the solution of big variation and social challenges ?
so if that 's the same other thing that 's going to solve the unknown , and if it 's a very different kind of different , you know ?
because what was that ?
both sides , they want , right ?
can we do that ?
you may ask .
so far , we 've seen that as a concept .
luckily , here 's an example of an example .
jay designer has done with his home , with his $ $ $ a $ $ $ $ $ poverty in a lot of power to poverty .
and also interestingly , a lot more just in this field of what 's called the breast industry .
and he turns out to be a politician , probably , probably , have taken the ted prize .
and the opportunity here is , i 'm going to make it with someone .
well , let me take a lot of grass .
in fact , dear young guy .
and it 's really great , but also its unexpected .
and so , you know , you 're totally cold .
i like to look like it .
and if you see that , you 're going to think about real real , at least , because we do n't need to worry about our future .
yes , in the way , after college , he 's starting to work in one of our own software for a moment .
that 's what he 's doing well .
that 's what it looks like , and it 's also very successful .
and there is something that 's going to be here .
so he 's like , there 's no more , i do n't know ?
that 's the kind of thing he 's going to say .
in all , you know , everybody 's in all .
and that would also like him .
and he 's also like that for him .
so the right line of the tea , and he 's basically the same .
so , it 's not that he 's interested in it , but that 's what 's called him .
and in the middle the middle of the video , he did n't tell you about three women .
and so more , he was surprised to be surprised when he was in the process of the trial .
and i call a guitar .
and as a neuroscientist , entrepreneur , he was looking at this .
it 's great joy , so with young people working together , there 's his experience .
and then the two people found it found together .
and there 's always been a little bit more .
how would it be ? if we just did so in one of those conversations from the two times ?
so , henry , you know , like that was exactly .
now , what is the difference between the new york city and what does it mean ?
i did n't understand that .
yeah , then , then , then , then , then , are we going to do the question , what is it ?
so , mr. said , `` yeah .
economies markets , controlled products , controlled customers , develop structures , there 's a map .
and you can also have to be quite accurate , where you can see the big difference .
and then it 's kind of funny , even though it 's a little bit , it can be .
so , what is that actually ?
so , you know , you 're very much likely to do one , it 's not that the small copy of a big company .
it 's something else .
it has a totally different character .
because it does n't stop anything .
not a commitment leader , not compromise , but nothing is known .
so this is a company , and it 's an amazing organization that is trying to find a business model , to find , to develop a business system , of course , of course , but that 's particularly , of course , and it 's going to scale .
and you 'll make sure that , of course , in so powerful , there are other other ways to be very different , very different , very different ways .
yeah , that 's already clear .
but what are we looking for ?
so , it 's like , i 've got it , and i 'm going to make it up there , because i 'm going to make you paid for money , right ?
so i 've got there , and i 'm going to say that does all work well , so on the rock police system in my lab , you 'd say that ?
that 's called a monster .
how do you feed your company for free , and for your life 's life for life .
oh no .
right ?
what do you think if you 've got your money at the beginning , what 's it for your own ?
so , you know , a career as a liberal performer , or what ?
so , what happens to your neighbor , how do you know ?
and what 's going to look at is what 's going on .
so the statistics on `` do n't give you , '' because 27 percent of all , you know , a few years earlier , there 's a much more likely than going on in front of us than your big run .
money is always going to be the result of a successful company and a good company .
yes , money is an energy for harmony .
and it 's the basis that we 're going to do the basis of this
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yeah , what 's the goal ?
the company ?
so , if i do n't know what i 've learned , so that there is no purpose of the right thing .
and so , of course , at some point , there 's always been effective , but so on .
and if i do n't have that all there , so , how can i do something like i do n't know what i 'm going to be ?
so that does n't make good sense .
so , like , i 'm going to decide and take risks and risks , that feel so focused and so forth .
yes , sylvia welcome in business .
but i do n't know what it is for you .
one thing .
so it 's already ready , so it 's almost already .
we did n't want to generation from generation to generation .
it 's a commercial fuel for transportation .
so , or how are you going to be today ?
i mean , i mean , is what ?
so we 're going to say , always , we 're going to make up
if you can go in to help health care and research and institutional sustainable health issues .
so it helps sense .
i think i can give you one of those .
okay .
yes , thank you , scott .
but there 's a question on it .
you can remember that in the same way that one of the important way to think about the important way we have good is good questions .
can we do that in the next one of the other people that i feel like it ?
so the first thing is i , and what do i want to do here ?
yes , does it go out , there 's a little thing about you , which is bigger than you ?
what are you doing in the world ?
what do the people who are working with you ?
what are you ready ?
what are your dna , or possibly , even more powerful ?
why is that so important that ?
because these are also your mental identities .
and how did we learn that ?
if you 're going to run a ship , and you do n't put the men together together to make a coffee in your own wood , but for example , you 're going to get the most efficient , sustainable ocean .
yes , good .
so , i 'm going to ask the next questions .
now , what 's my schedule ?
so what does that mean ?
yes , if you 're now , you 've got your target right now .
in the details of detail , but taking me , but i do n't have `` you 'll go in front of you in the same way , if you will , you know , what you do n't want to stay on .
do you actually tell the story with the pink elephant ?
it 's me standing here .
do n't you ?
in fact .
so , look at it .
if you do n't imagine , there 's no white elephant .
okay ?
okay ?
so , you have n't , like , say ,
how ?
there 's no white elephant .
you see ?
that 's how we focus on that focus on what we do n't want .
what is the only possibility ?
this is what we 're doing ?
yeah , yeah , that 's what you want .
so , you 're going to run off and maybe you 're going to have the balls on your
but let 's think about it .
by the way , what do i mean , you know , do n't call me ?
i 've got it here for me .
watch if you 're wearing .
tori 's going to fall out of god 's a fake restaurant smith .
who ?
at the moment , at the end of his day , tori makes a lead to think of state 's face 's a little bit of a
now , i used to take emails , who 's at the play of my own game at the moment of the day when they 're making this open for the moment of
i took the glass of the glass in the great aquarium .
i want to buy what 's called me open 's dance , sir .
and then i was like , `` do n't put me in my neck . ''
it 's called mahatma gandhi smith smith .
oh , if you played the name , you know ?
in a nutshell , by doing , tori , so , you get one of a sudden you 're going to make your face for free air 's
it 's taken off .
it 's the same a part of my own .
the real thing you 're going to do is , `` what 's the real buddha
and how does it look like ?
did you know what ?
has changed anything ?
okay .
okay , and the flower also .
okay .
so , let 's just look at the time .
we do n't .
tori 's going to fall out of god 's a fake restaurant smith .
who ?
at the moment , at the end of his day , tori makes a lead to think of state 's face 's a little bit of a
now , i used for example of who , at the last time , he 's going to open the top of their life at the moment of making a year
i took the glass of the glass in the great aquarium .
i want to buy what 's called me open 's dance , sir .
and then i was like , `` do n't put me in my neck . ''
it 's called mahatma gandhi smith smith .
and lo , how do you do that ?
so , i do n't know , i was also shocked .
i was truly shocked .
when i first saw the first time .
i thought it could n't be an obvious .
and much more exciting , i was in the head of my head , is it that i 've actually spent all the time all the time all the time ?
through my life .
and , okay , so , i understand that makes sense .
and the way to go out of this view is that we 're most of most of our sense of our sense of view and we need to our blueprint .
but what does it mean ?
what got the original thing i was , and what did i do ?
and that 's why , in order to make your sense of your sense of a place , it 's more important to quality .
well , yeah , thank you , we 'll come to the next question .
how could i actually come to my goal ?
so , i think that 's a good question .
now , i 'm going to do that , and i do n't know each other .
yes , uh , there 's good news for you .
it 's going to be easier than you 've done this before .
because if you lose your body , your head is driving , and if you make sense of your mind , very quickly , i promise you 're going to do it in there .
it 's almost like it .
you 're not going to be able to be different than that , you know , that 's a little bit in what 's going on you .
these are the famous rock you 've done in the morning you have .
and yet , the question is , i 'm going to show you what you 're doing , you know , you know , you know , if you 're going to be able to ask your questions to ask yourself , there 's more to be able to get home
and you have a big model .
and the research have said that this is a great artist .
now , i had an amazing book when who did n't know more , that was going to be in his community 's meeting .
for lunch , the famous great table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , you get , politicians , school , young engineers , architects , and he 's kind of a really nasty commitment .
but not in our collective senses where it went to go , yes , who 's going on ?
who 's right ?
but in fact , that suddenly found these different kinds of things that are never in no way one of you could n't have imagined .
well , yes , the next question is , what makes the move next step ?
there are some successful politicians at the point of the reason .
instead of doing it big , and it 's important , and so on , you just focus on the next step .
because what do you want to do in the area of uncertainty ?
but they 're going to come to this very well and end up .
and if you did n't do anything , you 're going to come to another step .
and even if the great ones that 's great , well , there 's nothing called others .
so it 's so important to tell you your mind .
that gives you the ultimate security .
and by the way , how do we all work ?
although we did n't know that , and there was no one ?
and you 're going to say , you 're going to be talking about kids .
so , this kind of thing learning learning to look at this , and i 'm doing this for play , it 's also a fun thing in a company in a company in a coma .
and that 's exactly exactly what we call it , which makes us feel so vulnerable .
yes , thank you , scott .
so it sounds quite great .
but i do n't know about you in the company , but i think there 's still a lot of things that happened to happen .
and for instance , in germany , there 's always such such as these .
and i think , by the politicians , the politicians had to worry about that .
my boy , come up with me .
how do you go back to the water .
what do you think so many people can do ?
ten ?
number thousand ?
ten million ?
watch down here .
who do you see ?
that 's exactly what .
that 's the one you can change , you can really change .
or to go to the barefoot artist to speak to the change , which you 're in the world in itself .
do you think beautiful words and big models , but how do that work work ?
since we have become lucky , we have a little bit of tea on our ipad .
working in a lot of the coal , or if you feel too small , for something , or if you 're a conservative , and you 're all to do with you .
and if you ask you in those situations , what you 're doing now is doing now , despite all of this , you can think of your health care ability to feel more powerful .
but if you ask you what you like to know about what you 're doing .
and all of a sudden , `` you know , what you 're going to do about this crisis , or what 's bad things about it .
so , i mean , if you 've already happened , it 's like , at least .
yeah .
thank you very much .
and do you think it 's going to help me in my way ?
yeah .
and lo and behold , really , two things .
first time , at the top of an idea of your mind , it 's going to be your self-interest of being .
because it determines your perception .
and the second thing on your brain is to tell you about .
because it makes you feel like the other people themselves .
the future is always only if we change our own perception .
do you want to do that ?
yes , i think .
thank you , scott , then then .
all of these good boxes .
yes .
what do you hold from your genome ?
nice .
really , right ?
and how are we actually doing this ?
is this a new factory ?
i mean , yes .
all right .
so i see , i see , in looking at the scene .
it 's just called it 's delicious .
and that 's what really means really .
a department of the youtube 's orchestra .
and no , this is new york , right .
but that 's the thing .
the only thing has been done in the great famous name of name .
and then by robert jazeera , `` dry '' and `` are dancing , '' or whatever .
let 's just put this new character .
and who may know that the next person is our time at our time .
you 're going to see right , i 'm a blogger .
so maybe it would be that i would like to kids and their future , after all , i mean , kids will be our future .
instead , that 's what i think most of our time .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , my father and i open up the program club for teenagers .
so , we 've designed training , which is , you can go to your muscle either , or you can find it either way , and you can think of a button that 's a button that you can think of .
so why do n't i ask me to do that ? so why do n't i take care of them , so those who have already made the big mistake ?
our program is not as easy as easy to understand how to kids .
and frankly , i would have thought that the aliens in the last place is in the universe where i would work .
what do you think is the most important factor in childhood with the people that we 're working with ?
what we 've found out there are positive models we can often accept the positive issues .
and if you think about it , why it 's so many and so many of the speakers there are often because of the father , he does n't have a long work that he will eat drugs , or he
and if then a young boy thought about what he wants to do for his life , he does n't have a better idea of what life could be like because he has no better models .
and he 's his father for his father .
i 'm afraid ' about them .
martin is the program of our program .
his father had been raped , and the whole family of life is life .
when he was 12 , his mother died , and he and his baby had to go home .
there he was the winner of big .
he was frustrated , and he was doing the perfect victim .
until the day that day , as his left brother at a game have been sold so long ago that he was left on ground .
there at the first time , at the first time , they went through , and he went on to go back and forth .
and that day , he got a lot .
and so we went .
violence was exactly about his life as well .
now , what about those who i just described about ?
after a childhood age , death has been a lot of road , or they have been fired .
you do n't know much of other forms of living in terms of your lifestyle activities and your home .
and then you 'll see them in a day with people in prison , which is the same way that the ideas around the same games are not the same things .
what do you think , are these people together in prison when they sit in prison ?
it 's mostly about not much good .
and they 're going to get better and better use of service .
they sell 500 drugs for a higher level , and they could do it in a higher level where they were able to do that .
and then this goes into germany , it 's growing up by 2015 .
that means , in germany , everybody 's going to take an international person in college .
but then there are people in prison who really want to change .
but also these people carry a line on their nose .
and it 's there .
and everywhere , where they come , that 's their first identity .
whether you 're going to go to a search if you 're looking for a hospital , if you want to create new private relationships , you 're going to deal with this identity , with this platform , which gives you an
that 's the problem we are .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what 's the property , do you think , making a lot of you with ?
you will be surprised .
they have more skills .
who , who has a fountain for me , it 's definitely a lot of curiosity , of what 's being done .
it 's a bit of a little bit of life on the issue of the issue .
these properties , we want to use for something positive .
we 're starting to start our program with an education education in prison , in three .
we 're going to understand the whole basic systems and economics .
so , every student writing their own life , and everybody 's going to be a tremendous mess .
and then we 're going to make the people who are going to be at the ministry of the ladder , and at the end of their personal relationships , and also in a kind of mess .
what kind of shrimp do that come from our program ?
it 's a big amount of data , which is a rubber service for a service .
we 've made a joint of tea .
a very large amount of scale , and what i do is to make you like to introduce your attention .
now , according to talent , and its illusion of a small money , it has taken him already very early for transportation .
he was always fun of doing business .
he 's then won for the first time .
and this paper does n't look like this .
quite the opposite .
he 's talking to himself , he 's now his last day for me .
and he 's like , he 's been born for a second time .
he just took it to a therapy , and then it 's on .
and he learned how he could use his creative talent for a little bit .
he 's gone down in february of february , and then 2007 's his built for business .
the prison works , it can live in life .
he was very good at this point .
he 's here with me here .
if you want to know that , let 's talk about it .
again , back to the book i told him about him .
and his childhood has become an education for his childhood , and i ended up in his own little days .
and there and drugs that were there at the ministry of the city , they 're pretty fast .
it worked as a trial and it 's a game .
twenty years he got this life .
and he 's now saying that at that time , he did n't have that life 's not true .
and then one day , he was so difficult for somebody to then he was raped .
and he took the head of it , and it really changed his life .
he learned how he got too more power to achieve more success and more quality of life without having to do without his job or without drugs without drugs .
and he was so excited about his work so he said that he would like to do it .
and he wanted to be part of that .
that 's what happened .
now , it has now since the number of two years that we have , and it 's focused on our clients towards their way towards freedom , because he knows that if you really want to change , and when you get the right tools with the hand , it 's much more possible than you
the basis of this foundation , by the way , is people like it .
people who are in the prison today , they come up with us with us to help our participants around their heads , to their own events .
these are our principles , the latest talks in our education , and these are students who are doing the factory , making their own business .
and these are our youth who are sending our participants to participate .
and these people take a lot of our program .
an example .
we 're doing a practice that we 're doing a practice called the calls .
we then turn into the middle of the room a large set of our subjects on one of our subjects , and our closest stand on the other side .
and i 'm going to ask you different questions .
and every question , when someone in the room , the question with the hot line , it 's on the line .
and here 's what we all have in common , whether we 're in the prison , or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and one of the things where the differences is there is the question .
i grew up in a social social store , or i had a graduate student .
there are usually a lot of our participants in the line and only a few of our efforts .
and one of the question i like to do is that all of us , i would like to ask you .
i want you all to please .
maybe we can get a little light in the audience .
i can see you .
it 's all .
great .
thank you very much .
now , i 'm going to ask you a question , and if you ask that question , you 're just going to answer it again , otherwise just keep you .
this is kind of our space that we 're now .
i 've done some things in my life , which i could have been asked for whom it was n't .
if you ask that question , please , please .
that 's why it 's going to be a broken car .
and it 's not going to have a little bit of a little bit of a mess .
that 's why we do n't have to deal with it .
okay .
and it also does n't matter that , perhaps do n't always have any work wrong .
all right .
most people .
we have some of them in the room .
that 's wonderful , i 'm happy .
thank you very much , you can get rid of every day .
in this question , when we look at these , our often come a lot of times into it .
and there 's also clear how much happiness you might have .
happiness , with the parents , happiness with the environment , in which they grew up with , with the friends , but also happiness , they may not have been there before , if they 've done something on the edge of the ladder or whatever they 've done
what are the results of our work ?
fifty percent of our research have been found from within a year 's time .
that 's pretty fast fast .
we 've already made it out .
a third of the last islands in the last year , they were .
and our revenues is at seven percent .
i 've had it already said the 27 percent of seven percent of a sudden germany in germany .
i 'm a blogger .
in a year year , in a year , it 's a $ autonomous dollars .
and it 's a beautiful dance , called what a library of our seven percent at a standard level of cases it means to be a means .
when my father and i started building this bike , we 're pretty good news of quite a lot .
and i was at the time at the very first time in a big company .
but i have to tell you , i did n't make my life work in my life .
we encourage our participants to take responsibility .
responsibility , what happens in your life , and most responsibility for what is going to happen in your life .
not to hide , not too much .
because that leads to a whole new enterprise , and it allows us to do it in terms of it .
and so it makes me very particularly happy , and proud of our participants is open from your way .
so , i 've got a little video here .
movie .
so i was convicted for two years and eight months of times , for example .
i was born because of the year for three years and 10 months old .
i 've come with tape .
so , i 've got two years of two years because i 've got to do smart .
i was born because of my bike and dance 's cooking .
so , through my career in life , it has changed my life life .
and what was important to me was this competition that was also done .
because it was my , my favorite favorite ,
i was n't shy , i was n't just saying , yeah .
i 've got to hold on top of goals .
i 've got to come back to perspective , and i looked back again .
and you go through a very different awareness of consciousness and out of your life .
so far , it 's still more and more and more expensive than it is there , and then you 're always doing it again .
and with the wrong people , and they do n't well .
well , the problem is , there is a lot of people who have no plan when they come up .
that 's the biggest problem , because it 's automatically being coming back into the old age .
you do n't know anything else .
this is a little bit of an example through this little individual , whatever everything that 's going to happen to me in my whole way about myself , about other , about others , talking about the relationship with society that has connected to me in this
i have since my first wife .
and since i was six months of my day , i was playing with her .
so that means we have a new relationship .
and because for me , i 've got through this whole thing and a lot of other things .
i 've already done a lot of time .
i 've come to my family with my family .
so i 'm working on my research , i do n't say .
i 'm going to do a dance for a nurse .
you have to really prove that there are very , very many people , actually , you actually , like , for example , i 've also been thinking about that time , and i do n't think about , and actually , i do n't know ,
i 'm grateful for the idea that they have come to the idea that they do .
i 'm grateful for having to make it in spite of security , and i 'm extremely grateful to be part of it .
and of course , the whole people who were doing this .
i 've been talking to a lot of people with a lot of people , and i 've always got this thing to do that .
and that 's what i do .
and for me , thank you .
come to prison .
each of you have something that we need .
whether you want to teach our participants in your spouse , whether you are as the liberal , whether you 're in the process of a financial support .
whether you want to do that program in a new store , it 's a really cool issue .
talk about us .
martin kahn and i 'm here today .
and listen to the conversation with you .
thank you very much .
for me , i 've come up at princeton 's for me for a company company to grow .
in one time in which i was a little bit .
there 's something like these things .
it 's going to be a little bit .
going to go .
it 's going to take a look at a cave .
now , there 's really a lot of ways we can deal with speech .
it 's about how you can relate to it .
anyway , i was also disappointed .
so with my work , and so she 's doing a little bit .
what i really need to talk about is here .
and not by real problems .
my problem was i had been , and i was able to be right in my life as my life in 10 or 30 years .
it was dreadful .
and i think that the soft thing i thought was .
so , in order to make it more funny .
and basically , i had a professional commitment .
it 's like private .
i just did n't know , i was going to go down the way away ?
just do it just look for me ?
or what if i had to put my new york back down ?
and watch what happens to happen .
so what 's going on .
that was the thought .
i was there a lot of free school at this time .
and i said , as i said .
it was also for me as well as a nuclear leader .
you 're going to take your world in very good in very good , and in terms of the land in a very dense way .
but also , however , also , very , very , very wealthy countries .
countries where it 's safe to see more and say more than a million villages with what 's going to be trained , although they do n't have anything , so happiness and joy .
so , just from those images , but also , it 's a bit of a bit of a bit .
and that was for me after a while .
i did n't know what i was doing .
it 's like it .
and also , i thought it was a little bit of a privilege of me on a country that i do n't really know .
that 's what i wanted to do .
i wanted to meet the whole thing .
and being asked by writing articles .
and to keep my personal interest .
how do you learn countries better ?
by interacting with people .
in humans , at home , at home .
not in the hotel .
by focusing with the challenges and deal with the problems of people .
and by working with people .
at least , that was the answer i could give to this question .
and that 's what i wanted to do .
i wanted to do something very interesting .
i wanted to do a long .
doing something good .
and i felt that feeling of what happens to me , it was growing up again ,
now , i 've been very often in developing countries , but in developing countries , but in developing countries , i 've just been so special
but until it was a cold state of war that not only did but both of economic and social problems .
in a $ income income , of bangladesh dollars is the u.s. land in asia .
and we continue to continue to one of the richest poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
almost a fifth of the population is suffering from malnutrition .
seventy percent of adults ca n't read and write .
all of these facts are connected with lots of personal stories , as well , i 've been on that journey by a time i was ready to be ready and open for change .
when i wanted to do something about myself .
and finally , after my head , my decision , my decision turned out .
i quit my job .
and then the aid aid .
and i 'm also going to just give you a copy of the answer i 've got to my job .
because she was just an app .
it 's a very serious research at harvard international companies .
and not to have a search for a brand that 's going to be going to take place for a second time , and a community community is looking for .
hello ?
is n't it ?
my job was really serious , and it was good .
at least i thought that .
and that 's an answer , it was a medical school .
i was really amazed .
and so , of course , there 's been an answer of what 's called the answer .
and fortunately enough , fortunately .
but instead , i do that , quite powerful sense to make a good thing .
i used to use it as a force for my own company .
sebastian .
sebastian cochrane , dance , dance , dance .
so , a company that is basically what i 've been looking at .
which is the possibility of finding a country else .
the possibility of getting a country right .
by living with the people in real places .
and not going to be able to work anywhere , but it 's in delicious .
now , in the way , you can get into two words .
so , anger and dance .
so that means so much of what you can do , i can talk about what i can do .
you can do good things .
now , this sounds sounds a little bit easier .
it 's not .
and what 's social is social business .
we use as an tool for sustainable sustainable .
in addition , we use as a tool for sustainable development .
so , you 're going to go , and i 'm dancing ,
because the people who are moving around with us as they have to identify with their potential .
you pay for your journey as well as a result .
but they travel differently .
they live in taiwan .
and it 's not a much of a lot of life , or it 's not a long time , but it 's real medical medicine .
social networking .
and it turns out .
so these are the participants who are ever interested in adolescents and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work on an internet internet network in areas that otherwise would n't have any chance to have been on a traditional language .
because there 's no infrastructure infrastructure .
to the other , we can be creative projects .
we can go to build in clinical sustainable projects .
so we 're moving to 60 percent .
they 're not on harm .
and this is the basis of our historical research of meaning .
we started with our work in tanzania .
we started our own engagement for uganda .
and now , for over four years now , i 've been married and my husband and i are also a team of a team .
do we go away ?
or what if we had bigger thinking ?
if we 're going to continue to keep it down ?
if we do n't just change the social media and sustainable change in terms of what we call it ?
and that 's what the individual of individual are doing ?
or even other individual uses .
so that 's basically a new enterprise .
one company that 's focused on companies .
but in other words , the same philosophy of philosophy , as well .
do we want it ?
was the next question .
sebastian new companies ?
we want to do that .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we 're in the same way .
because we know the same language .
because we have the same dreams dreams .
because we understand the challenges .
and so in that year , we asked an sister .
sebastian .
and what we do is we 're creative businesses in their development , and what we do is we 're going to support for smart people .
in this sense , we will learn the participants , doctors , who , from creative companies with individual development .
so , the personal social social , and they 've been replaced , of course , of course .
and put it down to the mast .
that 's where we 're going to do it again .
now , a practice that comes next to a process of a process of a process is another thing .
he shows it in relatively short time where you 're standing or where you 're going .
you know , where you might have a little bit more common .
where you may have too little material , you know , think of thinking .
and he 'll show you one thing .
so that 's going to move his body .
it 's the creativity that 's suddenly great awesome .
or , you know , the intelligence is to come .
the traditional things that you ca n't do is change .
and the force , things change you can change .
and you can do a lot of change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
an example .
so these are burning pumps , wheat and amjad .
these are five really wonderful women from school .
now , with speech and with talent .
it 's made beautiful , you 've been looking for years .
and for years , nothing happened .
because they did n't just have that market .
because they did n't know how to improve the quality .
because nobody said that , you know , you know , maybe design will .
we wanted to help these women .
and so that year , that 's why .
for example , hacking milk .
people get out of poverty .
they give them a income .
a future is possible .
we went here to our home live .
and we 're starting to start with a little bit of research .
a search of thousands of thousands of our women .
but not only for a year or not only for a year .
but also helps us to do the project a much bigger .
this is the first one , in a kind of social world , and it 's in one of the same .
so , you can want this to build this with a stick with a button for the other , but you can go to the project .
he can go to the women and then they travel .
in addition , we do n't want to buy five women in a work , it 's about a hundred or a hundred .
and not only in uganda , but also in bosnia , and in other contexts , in which we 're working research .
but here 's just a project of what we call a project in our collective space of projects .
we work in all the green areas .
in the midst of india , the health and health and the system of the system .
because the work is just too little bit too little .
what happens to children when women work ?
right .
that 's why we 've done in this year in tanzania , and in uganda , also , in the '50s , also , in the course of
all of this is true in our culture .
and the whole thing makes even more meaning than every single project .
we 're going to put them in terms of these different projects .
the only thing they 've done is they 're doing work together .
and finally , i want to leave you now right now on a journey .
and i 'm going to leave you to please .
in fact , you 're in africa .
in rural 's heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a keyboard .
and they 're happy and more .
you 've just run your car up to dinner .
there was rain .
sebastian .
thu-huong .
the walls are skillful .
and in this room , it 's extremely warm .
you get the window out of the window .
and that 's where kids are doing a little keyboard .
their feet foot in the sand .
you 're on your wallet .
it 's also a thin surface of water .
the kids laugh .
and call your name for your name .
you 're not going to tell you that you 're not just going to call them up .
sebastian .
you do n't know how much it is .
but soon , you 're going to buy up .
and the geese , which is still the children , the kids are .
at the end of the street , it 's a big tree .
so here you are going to meet you .
in the most famous part of the tree , you 'll see the new design of your physiology .
how do you talk to your hands and your feet .
later , there are other women .
they 're smiling .
until you go back to your english language .
underneath the tree .
so free .
incredible , there is no internet here .
tomorrow , you 're playing with your desk .
that 's what you 're going to do .
it 's something every every time .
but also , it 's nice to talk to you again .
you know music .
and that 's what we 've got to do this .
in black , in contrast , in the mirror , they 're going off .
she plays a new song .
you 're in love and happy .
you can feel your eyes again .
and each of us can get to meet themselves to something new .
or at least for a short time , a little bit of time .
and look what happens .
thank you .
before i start , i would be interested in , if you 're here tonight , they 're here for a moment .
now , i do n't really feel good with the light , but maybe someone wants to be able to .
i mean , in the bottom of the sound , i 'm looking
two .
i 'm not looking at the top of the eyes , but there 's already two two , that 's beautiful , and it 's just a time .
i 've also done a building , and the top mountain mountain in the city of the city .
this is the building .
so , along with 20 other people , i 've been watching the last last summer for six months .
and that 's why , i know here before you .
well , some of you might say some of you may say
what is it ?
well , there 's a lot of you .
but i want to explain it briefly .
well , what you 're going to do now ?
and you 're calling then in park , right ?
just a small choice of questions that are given us to know friends , friends , colleagues , as you know , i 'm part of a family that i 'm looking at , which is a little name of name ,
and all the time that we 've actually put ourselves in the canopy of their own bear .
and over here , they had been building this little building , and we had to do with them .
and it 's about to transform the production of these attacks .
but who knows me , this is not my own type of life .
and it was n't the most popular manager of health care .
what we 're seeing here is a sign of a sign from a garage in brooklyn .
this is a public space that is very private , and that 's why for a lot of people , i ca n't say , but not in a public hand , and so
we were a group of activists together at the desire to be trained to open up , to develop problems and conflict .
and we wanted to tell another story .
we 've been an engineer team , and that 's what i need to see now , because it was a very popular team .
from the very complex architecture , health care -- politics -- and open , of course , design , design , of course , is peaceful .
of course , also , in various social cultural and personal .
and then our focus , and it turns out .
and we 've been able to help in different ways , but also to separate networks .
and creative , we need solutions solutions in that , and we then set up to realize .
in fact , we actually have to go to square .
however , it was all about us to do with stories and ideas .
we have used to memories and images .
and out of these memories and images , what is trying to develop the way of designing video models .
and it was really important to us that the process of this process always went .
so as a medical self , we 've been thinking about as a matter and as a consequence .
so it was a cruel and an agent , and it turned to it and after it .
in the experiences that we 've made about it , i 'm going to night tonight tonight .
so , every city has broken places .
one of the brain will give you a face .
in many cases , these systems were obsolete , and , and they 're going to look at citizens as they were looking in .
they 're the dead places in a city , because they do n't often follow what we see in a public space .
so , for example , we 've got up here .
but these are also public public , the urban places , and it 's going to be a little bit of time .
you want to put these places who want these places , and you often tend to have a major interest in the place .
so , what has happened to do with me , these are some questions , some of them ask questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places in our city are not just a face .
no .
they 're the social places of our city , where our life live in place .
so we do n't even find first as a result of our neighbors when we 're going to meet ourselves in the way .
and if we just have a fancy opportunity , we can sit in , and we actually breathe , when the spaces are also designed to form .
and we 've been doing that same thing .
it gives us , sometimes , sometimes .
but what 's security is a sense of community .
the more i 've been living in a public space of the public room , and the more part of it is also the community .
and if i do n't , then what you 're wearing is called a national rule .
so we then started two challenges .
we can believe in the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for their local neighborhoods , or at the same time .
how can you run the phosphorus thing ?
how can we become leadership in ideas ?
for the sake of the violence , and they 're going to go to these places , and they do n't look for the use , and they also do n't actually look at them in the same places .
now imagine that you 're sitting on there , once you go up and read the newspaper .
in love , citizens and citizens , we hope you want to tell you three of the three ways for a little bit that 's done right .
you have to think about the idea of your imagination .
and the relationship with most of them , then , of course , will then transform .
would you go ?
would anybody to that event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds just great .
there 's a sense of what 's going on .
they 're allowed to get out what the future looks like .
and as i said , it 's just wonderful for the first moment .
i 'm also trying to think of an explanation .
and that , because i think you can not really be able to do anything or take care or care .
first , because traditional people are often late late at late .
that is , mostly , you do n't have an opportunity to make really your own work , or the basic alternative , but there 's actually a radical design , and you can still decide whether you 're going to build or clean them up into the green green system .
or , as a friend of friend said , what color is going to do is for example .
now , second story is about information and coordination .
think about the three stages .
we 've got here , we want to show you , and you 're going to get there .
video games and things are often what i feel like .
i mean , i do n't want to make a decision about if i want to buy if you want to buy what you 'd like to do if you 'd actually had gotten a little bit
but it 's also different .
despite the time that we 've been talking about a lot of thousands of conversations , we 've learned a lot of time .
and that 's what we 've been doing , and i want to share for other people right now .
i want to use it to other species of other species , in other projects , but also , or most of the world and the politics .
because those are the ones who do n't want to be doing this , and they 're actually responsible for this process .
if , in fact , the interest of a sudden is how many times we are going to , and then we 'll follow it , and then you need that for new york .
but i do n't last the last of them not last , but i 'm sure they 're sitting in here .
and that 's why i 'm interested in very important .
i keep it for matter that they 're all going to go , and i want to take them up with our desire to give them a chance to give us a chance .
and i 'm just looking at all of them because they 're the ones who they can use a new factory .
so we 've got to look at what are going to be in the citizens of consciousness and responsibility and engagement for their communities and to stop and do n't respond to power and to turn
first of all , for example , for example .
in a way , they 're trained trials to work , citizens in ngos and different interests .
what we 're seeing here is a camp that we 've chosen .
what we 're seeing here are some of the nurses and the lawyers in conversation .
the goal has to be that all of these conversations at ideo , so that 's not the ultimate interests of interest in terms of the circumstances of citizens .
the citizens in place are experts , they 're experts for their genes , they know what they 're doing , what they 're doing with a place in which tradition is a place and also give them to the place .
so , that 's what you can have in the city of what 's going to be on the city level of what 's going on in the project .
in any particular case , in a particular case , then there will be additional models that are going to be involved in a particular way , which is the only project .
all of that leads to a piece of water where all of information can be available for all the world , and then the place can be here .
by perhaps able to be able to get rid of a position of life .
a little bit of research also means that the students will get seriously seriously .
and then even if somebody says , i 'm going to take a loan to that .
so , of course , this may be going to be saved , but that 's going to be the goal of being done with all of all of the things that is the right solution , and maybe you 're going to have the course , but maybe in another place .
as i said , it has to come out of what 's going on .
second point , you 're going to be distributed .
we 're up with our bones .
and one of them will feel true if he 's going to talk about this great group .
now , one of the other people can do well , but they would n't write the text , they do n't want to talk about a big group .
a other kind of object might happen , or what is happening .
or build his ideas into happiness .
what i 'm going to say is going to be different , to be able to look at various times .
so , for example , we 've got an opportunity to just get there , just come up there , just once you see what happens .
in the background , the small show .
we 've had the opportunity to give up .
we have the opportunity to paint .
we have the opportunity to write .
regardless of the age .
this was an italian girl .
we had the opportunity to play our ideas with video ideas .
also , the way that comes out of sync are trying to learn themselves .
for example , for example , what can happen about it , it can be a very popular thing .
so , the catadores and the nonprofit laws of the results , the result of the result of the result of the research is
so , we 're all working on facebook and on facebook , and on a sudden they end up , and at the same time , it spread a little bit .
our third point on .
you may remember that i was n't going to die at the age .
in my own career career , i had three months ago .
but now , the process is , only if you 're going to go around and do n't even know what 's going to happen to be a little bit of stage .
when i 'm talking about this , and i 'm going to come back to the point where i 'm going to be one of the time , and what 's going to be an area of an area .
but also , by the way , also , by the way , it 's
and then , if it did n't work from the start , that 's what it looks like this , and it 's like it , but it 's just looking at the experience of what 's experience .
what happens next to when citizens are turned their city and their city .
it 's already seen in lots of projects .
i 'm doing this example of a bike paper that 's the critic , it 's probably known for many here .
in new york , just launched a project , which is a little bit .
it 's actually done within six weeks of weeks , you 've got to do that in six weeks , or at least .
and the time that in the 1990s , the policy could n't do n't different than the idea of their own .
also , in new york , i think i do n't need to think about it , because it has now become one of the most important in new york city is not an idea of politics .
on the contrary , which has been sold to the bears .
we 've come back to germany , and so we 've gone back to germany , the citizens have already known to the rise of a field .
the city was n't even for the city .
the four weeks that we have made for a bike house , which is a lot of living .
today , the city city has a city .
while the site of india is wonderful wonderful , and the city of the factory , which the media community , who have been there and other people who are trained .
what happens to be true is their own name on the street .
now , in bulgaria , a one-eyed of tea started ,
all right , so let 's say .
now , we 're going to just run this off .
but i think it 's true to have a city of responsibility .
why ?
for one , because they 've got a look for it for the whole .
as they say , in terms of business , you know , are citizens , or businesses , in the rule for themselves to be in some form of information that has been on the edge of attention .
and for the other , of course , if the city did the projects , then there 's other tools .
so , a nonprofit health initiative can just pay these only .
our goal was to the end of the goal , by the way , a global study that would have been asked for a year and about half a year , the results and the responsibility to the city .
in the art of the london , she wrote a video that 's bought in january .
we 're going to go ahead .
so , unfortunately , the problem is , we do n't have the responsibility to do that .
but we already know that when the city will get a lot of research , when the research are actually successful , that will become a dish .
so , in which forms of space is still open .
and to conclude , i 'm convinced that , many , many , many , many projects , that because of their meaning , complexity , or even their cost of the city , have to provide a chance to create robotic weapons .
if you just run time and you 're going to talk to the citizens .
in the same from the city and citizens .
in the course of the city and all of you who you 're sitting here tonight .
if we do our business , and at the same time , what people do n't think of is more as a musician , but as a result .
that 's it .
and yesterday , the night , we were here in the jungle , and we 've come in here .
we talked about cheating .
so this idea , you have had a second chance when it did n't work in this life , just as well as well .
so , we found quite exciting .
and we 've been relatively quick to realize there are two things we do n't even want to .
that 's what she is .
the second thing was there was still going to be there at the table in school ?
there 's no way .
there 's no way .
in school , some of you may remember , maybe , of course , go out of sand .
i mean , it 's like it now , it 's now taken years ago , but the words are going to open me immediately .
my crew was sitting together , and i just want to go back to him .
and then i do n't know what it was in my mind , but in my writing , he was able to take it off with the bell seriously that was always sitting next to me .
i do n't know what 's going on .
you 're going to see it , so , i did n't really know where i was really beautiful , and after i got my last book behind me , it was pretty clear .
and what i 'm going to say now , when i look at this year , some of the most beautiful days i 've been doing , i 've done in schools .
so , with great effort , and it 's got to be completely
how did it come ?
how could that happen ?
and that 's just what i began with that something is happening , which i could n't think at all .
i got kids .
so my wife got the kids .
and so it was also clear that she was the one who had to take care of those attacks .
until one day she said , she said , `` it 's up . ''
and today , you go .
yes , uh .
and then i go down the door , and then i sat there in this room and i realized , and i felt myself into the factory .
it looked just like it was in front of us .
and it was just as well as i was at school , and i 'm terrified , and i 'm doing it , and i 'm doing it , and i 'm doing it , and i 'm singing , and i 'm
and then , when i told the teacher , and you know , the children do n't learn to school , but for life , i do life ' `` oh my god , '' i said , `` kids do n't learn to school , but for life , i
what is that , what we 're doing from school , from this kindergarten , really , could really end for life ?
so a lot of us have learned really well .
where do you actually look at your life in your life , right ?
and perhaps , some of you know what is the threat of disease .
what 's more frustrating ?
or , you know , this ability to be a little bit of knowledge in yourself , just before i can do it on a button of a button , until i 'm bad ?
well , i 've got this time for you , but otherwise ?
and what does it mean to me from one point of being a good doctor ?
and if it is , if it is , and that 's the good stuff ?
there 's no way .
so , food , for life , not for school we learn .
if we look like this , the way we 've done about a year ago , in the 19th century , that 's like that .
this is the time that in germany , at the end of germany , at the end of germany , at the end of germany ,
and where the system system , as we 've now has its roots .
and if we started time then , it was actually the same way that people had n't access to their time .
and there were those four or six years that they were basically forced to go to school and to be able to know , and that really was the only way that they had to deal with knowledge and knowledge and the information of their time .
today , a century has more information in its pocket than the largest library of the time .
and the middle of the 19th century , which was the era of the palace .
that is , there 's a lot of changes in the world , and there 's a lot of people who can use these new machines .
but at the same time , people need these machines have to go out and fix these machines .
and we needed people to build these machines , and those factories were working .
maybe you see it already .
so , the system system that we have in germany now has to have its root at this time .
and it did n't make sense .
well , because it was probably the case that i was probably going to do that , what i 've been doing in the school since the work , i mean , who is at the right , and it 's been alive for his life .
we 're going to take them into the future .
let 's go back to the 21st century where it is , and let 's take a look at this .
the year was the year , there was the first first thing just ever about before .
i was in my research , and i thought , well , this is the time , now , you 're going to pick you up the first company .
yeah , after some of you walk around , i 'll buy the internet , i do n't buy it , i do n't like it .
and there are some companies that are getting back to us , and they have been bigger and more and bigger , and we 've been so beautiful , and some of the companies are at us as well .
you can watch two times in life .
and we had yet had a few years ago .
so , we had such a nice growth , and we had the best amount of creative jobs at the board like this , and we did n't make up cold .
now , i do n't know if they have invented mathematical vision what these people are doing , but when i went to school , we did n't have an idea that would ever do anything .
so , even when i went out , the internet is not talking about the internet .
and the kids that are in the school today where we 're going to send the job where they 're in 10 , or six , 20 or 30 years ?
the only honest response is no idea .
and what do you know what the facts will need to be in this future ?
and if you 're honest , the only answer , we do n't know .
and because we 're going to look like that in the future , who could do that , because they 're going to give up for the stage .
there 's `` harry alley , '' i read .
well , look , you have no idea .
how do we get out of what school for our life ?
what are the things that we need to make children for life ?
and maybe it helps us a look into what companies look for today .
that 's the school of school , right ?
the work from schools and universities come into the business .
and if you look at the kind of alien , you know , it 's because of the first place , just like this .
so , you know , so you know , they 're going to read this up , we 're going to search for 10 years to 10 years , and those 12 years ago .
this will be high school at school .
but what i could do , is the things that are always going to be important , these are what 's called `` oops , '' and i 'm convinced of that , this will be going to be the same will be free of the future .
and you can use it in terms of three groups .
so this is one , for companies , you know , who are flexible , you know , that 's one .
and then everybody wants to think about all the companies in thinking .
and then you want to attract those companies who are hungry .
so we 've got to think of emotional leaders and say .
let 's start with the rise of disease .
that 's relatively fast .
if we look at how economies now works , how fast how fast it changes .
in fact , the whole business models are going to run on the internet of the internet today .
so , there 's the job of me who can deal with this change .
so , it 's the training that i 've got , who are creative .
it 's the training of me who are hungry .
this is pretty much the opposite of what happened in the late at the end of the century century 's elected century .
but the second thing that 's going to think is relatively obvious .
there is about responsibility .
it 's about people , for people .
first time , for your own life .
but also for the big whole .
whether that 's the business or even as a society , we have to teach people the responsibility for the big whole .
and the third factor , which is , you know , is going to be the most number of the number .
and if we look at the back , then there was some of the internet in the internet .
in 1991 , india has grown and germany , and germany has a team .
it was n't a senior college who has won the world .
they could just do that in common .
and again , this big , of course , steve jobs , yes , yes .
it was n't the one who invented the iphone , who did n't have invented invented , who did n't invent what was invented .
it had a team that made it possible , because it had been that what you 've done .
so my school , who could combine these three things , that 's what we 're going to learn for life .
but there 's still a fourth fourth , and that 's probably more important .
and this is learning itself .
if the only thing we can say about the future of security is that they 're not secure , then the ability to learn more and learn new , and have fun of learning as we live in life , and our children are successful in the future .
but that 's what , you know , school , that these things happen .
but where was i ?
i was sitting in this room and those of you , the kids , who know that this is not just a permanent event to have to pay up to .
so , for example , i 've never said everything about it .
until the point where they 're going to be treated , then all of us are invisible .
yes , i was sitting there , and what i was going to say , at the end of one of my children , those were still the latest parts of the event .
it was much fun for me as a father , when you go to the game about the day , and you learn all of your life .
and even less fun , when the child is sick , because the school is supposed to be there .
and finally , this obsession or was a peak of those education at that same school .
and in fact , it was n't like a vacuum , so it was a bit of an egg , so right after the last hour , and in fact , we were also the only parents who were invited .
and i do n't dance to you now , and i was also looking at the details of time after time , we need to put our child out there , that 's not sure .
but we 've got two years where we 've come out there , because it does n't work .
what are we going wrong ?
and we had the question , `` we 've got our child right now ?
and are we the only who we are ?
now , i 've been in the last two years since i 've been talking to the issue of what i 've talked very many people about a lot of people , and i 've noticed , `` you are n't . ''
there are lots of many of the many things that it looks like this , and this was about two years ago , and we were just about trying to do a new company , and then they sat on the journey , and we
and what i 'm going to say , he has given me the same story with one of his children , and he was almost the same thing as we , and we were so fortunate that we were our kids from school , yes ?
in berlin , there is one thing in different schools in different schools , and we 've been able to go into school .
but can everyone out there ?
somehow , it was too little , just to bring our children in security , and that it could be out there as well as they were .
and after that , after we 've been given this , we 've been able to make it that way since we were n't really changed , yeah , we 're the first ones that 's going to do now .
so , how are we going to do something as an agent ?
the good thing is we 've got .
we 're not alone .
but we 're relatively , relatively , very quickly , lots of amazing people , what kind of wanted to do , which is what we wanted to do , which is what i wanted to do .
it 's not that just the children , and their parents know , what happens out there a lot .
when we look at the teachers , 30 percent of the teachers have paid .
if we look at how the number of resilience has changed over the last 10 years .
can it be that all the parents will get wrong ?
all the children are pregnant , and the teacher are up there ?
or , can it be that we have a system that just do n't mean more like this , not like this album , when it does n't work two years ago , it does n't really get that right .
and we 've found a lot of people who were similar to this , and we even found people that do n't have kids .
and they 've understood that you have to take responsibility for the future that you need to take responsibility for the future , by taking your responsibility for what we teach our children and the kids who are now going to go to school .
and we set up at a second second moment , there 's all kinds of news projects going out of school , and there 's a great schools there , and there 's really great schools , and there are almost great
and there 's even one other or another , but then you go to the first step .
and how should we now be as a musician ?
so we had no concept that we could be able to talk about it .
but we can do one thing , we can go to these schools , and we can go to those schools that are the people who school , so the parents , the teachers , the teachers and the students , and the students , and the
so there are people who have been working on in the past , and they learn it in two days what it means to work .
they come together with all really cool challenges that they solve .
and after two days , they were able to provide a new tool , or for example , to make a new high school high school , as we were to have to come to a school school .
or they have some basic role of data that they have in their school .
in the two days , the new days was developed , the next day we can do this day .
but what 's happened about those two days , and that 's what makes it for me to do so nice , which i 've got to do , then i 'm going to spend a lot of schools in germany , and it 's this energy , which is
if you can see the three things together , it 's just what it means organic .
so , think about it , and when you 're seeing it as a team .
and then it 's kind of a piece of wood , which i call .
and when we got four weeks after so , we learned how to get back back to school , and we learned that as a whole , as a result , that was being totally new culture .
and that 's incredibly cheap .
and i 'll ask you to think a new school .
i invite you to think about school .
and i said , `` i do n't know about school .
talk about what they 're doing , but they 'll talk about what they do n't like .
you 'll be surprised as much as you 've got , and how many people have looked like the same thing , but just not talking about it .
let 's leave us every single school in germany in germany .
let 's change the whole system system .
and let 's do that with the people that day for day , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because we can do that .
thank you .
